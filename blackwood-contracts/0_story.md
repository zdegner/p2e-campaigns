# The Blackwood Contracts — Story Overview

## Target Audience

This campaign is designed for experienced players (ages 30s-50s) familiar with classic fantasy (Tolkien, D&D), dark fantasy (Witcher, Bloodborne), and investigative fiction (Sherlock Holmes, True Detective). Players who enjoy:

- Solving mysteries through careful observation and logical deduction
- Planning and preparation over pure combat optimization  
- Morally complex scenarios where "the right choice" isn't obvious
- Rich lore and worldbuilding they can discover through play
- Darker, more mature themes handled thoughtfully

## High-Level Story Arc

### Premise

The Blackwood March—a frontier region on the edge of civilization—has always been wild and dangerous. But in recent months, monster attacks have intensified in both frequency and strangeness. Creatures that shouldn't exist are appearing: chimeric beasts with multiple heads, intelligent undead that coordinate tactics, predators that seem purpose-built to slaughter specific targets.

The Order of the Silver Chain, a guild of professional monster hunters, has been overwhelmed with contracts. They send the heroes—promising new recruits or experienced hunters from elsewhere—to investigate the worst cases.

What the heroes will discover over the course of 25+ sessions:

1. **Act I (Levels 1-3):** The monsters are artificial, created through alchemical-magical fusion by a rogue researcher named Dr. Erasmus Venn
2. **Act II (Levels 4-6):** Venn is being sponsored by corrupt members of House Blackwood, the March's ruling family, who want monsters as weapons and test subjects
3. **Act III (Levels 7-9):** The monster creation is actually a cover for a darker goal—feeding a primordial entity called the Hollow Sovereign to weaken the barrier between worlds
4. **Act IV (Levels 9-10):** Stop the Hollow Sovereign's manifestation and decide the fate of those corrupted by its influence—including potential PC corruption

### Themes

**Knowledge as Power**  
Understanding a monster's nature, weaknesses, and origins is as important as martial skill. The heroes must research, investigate, and learn—combat is the culmination of preparation, not the primary challenge.

**The Cycle of Violence**  
Monsters often create more monsters—through infection, curse, or vengeance. Breaking these cycles requires wisdom to know when to kill, when to cure, and when to contain.

**What Makes a Monster?**  
The campaign constantly questions this: Is it the shape of the body? The presence of a soul? The capacity for cruelty? The heroes will encounter:
- Innocent creatures hunted for their appearance
- Humans who commit monstrous acts
- Monsters seeking redemption
- Former heroes transformed into beasts

**Corruption and Sacrifice**  
How far will you go to gain power? What price will you pay to protect those you love? The campaign offers optional "corruption" mechanics where heroes can gain monstrous abilities at the cost of their humanity.

**Frontier Justice**  
In the March, law is what you make it. The local nobility is distant and self-serving. The common folk look to hunters, not authorities, for protection. This creates moral complexity: Who decides guilt? Who deserves mercy? What happens when the "right" choice conflicts with the lawful one?

## Major Story Beats

### Arc 1: The Pattern Emerges (Sessions 1-8, Levels 1-3)

**Inciting Incident:** Heroes arrive in Thornhaven, capital of Blackwood March, and receive their first contract—investigate the massacre at Rivermeet Manor

**Rising Action:**
- Complete 3-4 contracts involving different artificial monsters (chimeric wolves, intelligent ghouls, a phase spider that hunts specific bloodlines)
- Each contract provides clues: alchemical residue, surgical scars on creatures, journal pages from "Dr. V"
- Meet key NPCs: Master Jorah (guild leader), Constable Kael (honest lawman), Lady Mira Blackwood (reformist noble), "Old Meg" (eccentric monster-lore expert)
- Discover underground facility where monsters are created; find evidence Dr. Venn is the creator

**Crisis:** The heroes track Venn to an old mill. Confrontation reveals he's not the mastermind—he's being sponsored by powerful patrons and believes his work will "save" the March from future threats

**Reversal:** Venn escapes but drops evidence implicating House Blackwood's steward, Lord Treasurer Hadrian Morth. The heroes must now investigate nobles, not just monsters

### Arc 2: The Conspiracy Unveiled (Sessions 9-16, Levels 4-6)

**Inciting Incident:** Heroes investigate the nobility and discover Morth is part of a secret society called "The Crimson Quorum" that has infiltrated House Blackwood

**Rising Action:**
- Balance official contracts with covert investigation of the Quorum
- Navigate noble politics—Lady Mira becomes an ally, but other nobles are hostile
- Uncover Quorum meeting place and learn their goal: they're stockpiling monsters to stage a coup against the current Lord Blackwood (who they see as weak)
- Discover Quorum members have been experimenting on themselves—some have grafted monster parts for enhanced abilities
- Find references to "the Sovereign" in Quorum texts, but don't yet understand what it means

**Crisis:** Quorum stages their coup; Lord Blackwood is killed, and Thornhaven descends into chaos as stored monsters are unleashed throughout the city

**Reversal:** Heroes can stop the immediate threat and capture/kill several Quorum members, but Hadrian Morth escapes to an ancient elven ruin in the deep Blackwood. Evidence found in his estate reveals the truth: the coup was a distraction. The real goal is a ritual to awaken something called "the Hollow Sovereign"

### Arc 3: Into the Blackwood (Sessions 17-22, Levels 7-9)

**Inciting Incident:** With Thornhaven secured (new regent appointed, heroes are celebrated), the party must venture into the deep Blackwood forest to stop Morth from completing his ritual

**Rising Action:**
- Journey through corrupted wilderness; the closer to the Sovereign's prison, the more reality warps
- Encounter warped creatures, sentient forests, zones of reversed time
- Discover ancient elven texts that explain: the Hollow Sovereign is a primordial entity of emptiness and hunger, imprisoned millennia ago by elven archmages
- Morth believes awakening it will "purge" corruption from the world by consuming everything—including the Quorum's own sins
- Find and confront Dr. Venn, who has realized his error and offers fragile alliance; his knowledge of the monsters' creation can help undo the ritual

**Crisis:** Heroes reach the Sundered Sanctum, an ancient prison-temple where Morth has nearly completed the ritual. The Sovereign is partially manifested—a reality-distorting void-entity that corrupts everything nearby

**Reversal:** To stop the ritual, the heroes need components from the very monsters they've been hunting—poetic justice requires them to use "monstrous" solutions. They must choose whether to trust Venn's redemption arc or find another path

### Arc 4: The Hollow Crown (Sessions 23-30, Levels 9-10)

**Inciting Incident:** Even with the ritual disrupted, the Hollow Sovereign has tasted reality and cannot be fully sealed—it must be destroyed or fully reimprisoned, which requires re-performing the ancient elven rite

**Rising Action:**
- Gather components and allies for the counter-ritual
- Confront corrupted Quorum members who now serve the Sovereign willingly, having been "hollowed out" and turned into void-touched thralls
- Optional: PCs who took corruption abilities feel the Sovereign's call and must resist or embrace it
- Navigate collapsing reality around the Sanctum as the Sovereign pulls more of itself into the world

**Climax:**
- Multi-stage boss fight against Hadrian Morth (now a void-touched abomination) and the partially-manifested Hollow Sovereign
- Environmental hazards include reality tears, time distortions, and manifestations of the heroes' greatest fears
- Choice: Destroy the Sovereign (safe but leaves the Blackwood March scarred and dangerous) or imprison it again (requires ongoing vigilance and possibly a PC sacrifice)

**Resolution:**
- Blackwood March is saved but forever changed
- Heroes must decide the fate of Dr. Venn and other Quorum members who were manipulated vs. those who acted willingly
- Epilogue: Where do the heroes go from here? Continue with the Order? Retire? Guard the Sovereign's prison?
- Optional: Seeds for future campaigns if players want to continue (other cells of the Quorum in other regions, more primordial entities, etc.)

## Living World Rules

If the heroes don't actively pursue the main plot:

- **Act I:** Venn creates more monsters; villages are destroyed; +1 to "Monstrous Incursions" clock every 2 sessions (doom at 6/6)
- **Act II:** Quorum consolidates power; Thornhaven becomes more oppressive; +1 to "Coup Preparation" clock every 2 sessions (coup triggers at 4/4)
- **Act III:** Sovereign's influence spreads; corrupted zones expand; +1 to "Reality Decay" clock every session (point of no return at 8/8)

The world doesn't wait for heroes. NPCs will act independently—sometimes successfully, sometimes catastrophically.
