## Campaign Structure Validation

### Story Coherence ✓

**Mystery Structure:**
- Clear inciting incident (Rivermeet massacre)
- Progressive clue revelation (alchemical residue → Venn → Quorum → Morth → Sovereign)
- Multiple discovery paths (prevents dead ends)
- Escalating stakes (monsters → conspiracy → apocalypse)
- Satisfying resolutions at each act
- Multiple ending options (heroic, pyrrhic, dark, compromise, failure)

**Witcher-Style Monster Hunting:**
- Investigation-first approach (gather intel before fighting)
- Research mechanics (identify weaknesses, craft gear)
- Preparation matters (reduces combat difficulty)
- Moral complexity (not all monsters deserve death)
- Each contract is self-contained but connects to larger mystery

**4-Act Structure:**
- **Act I:** Establish pattern (monsters are artificial)
- **Act II:** Unveil conspiracy (Quorum and Morth)
- **Act III:** Reveal true threat (Hollow Sovereign)
- **Act IV:** Stop apocalypse (seal or destroy Sovereign)

Each act has crisis, reversal, and escalation ✓

### Character Hooks ✓

**6 options provided:**
1. Guild Initiate (ties to Order and Jorah)
2. Survivor (personal stakes)
3. Scholar of the Unnatural (research-focused)
4. Noble's Retainer (political connections)
5. Haunted Hunter (corruption subplot)
6. Outsider Specialist (fresh perspective)

Each hook provides:
- Connection to campaign themes ✓
- Mechanical benefit ✓
- Narrative hooks throughout ✓
- Different play styles supported ✓

### Mystery Investigation ✓

**Clue Structure (Session 1 Example):**
- **Core Clues (always found):** Tracks, alchemical residue, surgical scars, journal fragment
- **Extra Clues (reward checks):** Witness interview, attack pattern, chemical analysis
- **Redundancy:** Multiple paths to same information
- **Fail-Forward:** Even failed checks provide partial info

**Investigation Loop (Teaches Players):**
1. Investigate crime scene
2. Research monster type/weakness
3. Prepare specialized gear/tactics
4. Hunt the creature
5. Resolve and connect to larger mystery

Repeated across all contracts ✓

### Faction Dynamics ✓

**6 Factions with Clocks:**
1. Order of the Silver Chain (Guild Reputation 4/8)
2. House Blackwood (Political Stability 6/8)
3. Crimson Quorum (The Awakening 0/8 - doom clock)
4. Thornhaven Watch (Corruption 3/8)
5. Greenwardens (Alliance 0/8 - can go either way)
6. The Hollowed (Corruption Spread 0/6 - late campaign)

Each faction has:

- Consequences at max/min ✓

### Living World Rules ✓

**Consequences of Inaction:**
- Act I: +1 to Monstrous Incursions clock every 2 sessions (villages destroyed)
- Act II: +1 to Coup Preparation every 2 sessions (Quorum consolidates)
- Act III: +1 to Reality Decay every session (corrupted zones expand)
- Point of no return defined (8/8 = campaign failure unless heroic sacrifice)

**NPC Independent Actions:**
