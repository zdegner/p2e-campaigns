**Affiliation:** Order of the Silver Chain (Leader)

## Quick Reference

- **Race/Class:** Dwarf, Retired Monster Hunter (Fighter/Ranger equivalent, level 12)
- **Age:** 207 years old
- **Location:** Silverchain Guildhall, Thornhaven
- **Attitude:** Mentor / Friendly (starts at Helpful to heroes)

## Aesthetic

**Appearance:**
- Grizzled dwarf with iron-gray beard braided with silver chains
- Missing left eye (replaced with glass prosthetic engraved with guild symbol)

- Wears practical leather armor even at desk; silver dagger always at belt
- Hands are calloused; moves with slight limp (old leg injury)

**Mannerisms:**

- Direct and blunt; no time for flattery or politics
- Taps desk with knuckles when thinking
- Refers to heroes as "you lot" or by last names
- Softens when talking about deceased hunters (shows grief briefly)

**Voice/Speech Pattern:**
- Short sentences; military efficiency
- Uses hunter jargon: "Track it," "Know your prey," "Never hunt alone"
- Occasional dark humor about death and danger
- Shows approval through gruff nods, not praise

## Drives

**Primary Motivation:** Protect the innocent from monsters; train the next generation of hunters to survive

**Secondary Goals:**
- Maintain Order's independence from political influence
- Preserve institutional knowledge (bestiaries, techniques, histories)
- Honor fallen hunters' memories through competent successors

**Personal Goal:** Retire knowing the Order is in good hands; groom a successor

## Levers (What Moves Him)

**Positive:**
- Appeals to duty and protecting civilians
- Evidence of monster activity (he takes all threats seriously)
- Threats to Order members (protective of his people)
- Showing competence and professionalism
- Asking for guidance (he likes teaching)

**Negative:**
- Political manipulation or bribery attempts (offends his integrity)
- Recklessness that gets hunters killed (triggers his guilt)
- Disrespect for fallen hunters
- Suggestions that the Order is obsolete or unnecessary

## Secrets

**Known to Few:**
- Once hunted his closest friend, a dwarf named Kragdin, who was turned into a vampire
- Still carries guilt about having to stake Kragdin; questions if he could have saved him
- Has nightmares about that hunt; why he never sleeps more than 4 hours

**Hidden:**
- Considering retirement within the year; worried about succession (no clear heir)
- Suspects the Order has been infiltrated (Quorum has approached members with bribes)
- Keeping a "black ledger" of suspicious contracts that seem designed to distract the Order

**Critical Secret (Act II Reveal):**
- Was once offered membership in the Crimson Quorum 20 years ago; refused and exposed them
- Quorum has wanted revenge since; Morth personally dislikes him
- If Quorum wins, Jorah is on their assassination list

## Tactics (If Corrupted / Hostile)

**Note:** Jorah should never willingly turn hostile. If corrupted by Sovereign or replaced by doppelganger:

**Combat Style:**
- Guerrilla tactics; uses terrain and traps
- Knows heroes' strengths/weaknesses intimately (trained them)
- Sets ambushes using hunter techniques
- Retreats if outmatched; fights dirty to survive

**Abilities:**
- Expert with crossbow and silver dagger
- High Survival, Stealth, and Monster Lore
- Can craft traps mid-combat
- Resistant to fear and mental effects (iron will)

## Quotes

**On First Meeting:**
> "Contract came in overnight. Wedding party—two dozen guests—slaughtered. Witnesses say something unnatural did it. You lot are the ones available. Questions?"

**On Competence:**
> "Good work. Fast, clean, minimal collateral damage. That's how it's done."

**On Loss:**
> "Every hunter I've sent out who didn't come back... I remember their names. All of them. Don't make me add yours to that list."

## GM Notes

**Using Jorah:**

1. **Mentor, Not Solver:** Jorah provides guidance and resources, but doesn't solve problems for heroes. He trusts them to handle contracts.

2. **Show, Don't Tell:** Show his care through actions (providing extra supplies, worrying visibly, praising competence) not speeches.

3. **Grief Moments:** Occasionally show his trauma (nightmare if heroes stay at guildhall, thousand-yard stare when discussing lost hunters).

4. **Earned Respect:** He starts professional; heroes must earn his deeper trust through competent work and integrity.

5. **Sacrifice Weight:** If Jorah dies, make it impactful. Don't kill him casually. His death should save the heroes or the March.

**Jorah's Test (Session 1-3):**
- Watching to see if heroes are competent (can they complete contracts?)
- Watching to see if they're professional (do they minimize collateral damage?)
- Watching to see if they're ethical (do they care about innocent lives?)

If heroes pass all three: Full trust by Session 4.
