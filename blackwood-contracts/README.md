## Campaign Summary

A series of mysterious monster attacks plague the frontier region of Blackwood March. What begins as simple contract work for a fledgling monster hunters' guild escalates into a conspiracy involving corrupted nobility, forbidden research into creating artificial monsters, and an ancient curse that threatens to transform the entire March into a domain of nightmares.

The heroes must investigate each attack, track down the creatures responsible, and piece together clues that reveal a horrifying truth: someone is deliberately creating these monsters as part of a ritual to awaken something far worse.

## What Makes This Campaign Special

- **Mystery-Driven:** Each contract is an investigation first, requiring players to gather evidence, interview witnesses, and deduce the monster's nature before confronting it
- **Monster Hunting:** Inspired by Witcher-style preparation—research weaknesses, craft specialized gear, set traps, and exploit vulnerabilities
- **Moral Complexity:** Not all monsters are evil; some contracts involve protecting innocent creatures or negotiating solutions
- **Living World:** The March changes based on which contracts the party accepts and how they resolve them; faction clocks advance whether PCs interact or not
- **Player Agency:** Multiple approaches to each contract (direct assault, stealth, negotiation, ritual banishment)

## Themes

- **Knowledge as Power:** Understanding your prey is as important as combat skill
- **Cycles of Violence:** Monsters often create more monsters; breaking the cycle requires wisdom
- **Frontier Justice:** Who decides what is "monstrous"? The authorities? The victims? The hunters?
- **Corruption and Sacrifice:** How far would you go to protect what you love?

## Content Warnings

- Monster body horror (creatures with disturbing appearances/abilities)
- Themes of human experimentation and transformation
- Village-scale tragedy (destroyed settlements, mass casualties)
- Optional dark choice: permanent character corruption
