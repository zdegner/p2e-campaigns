# The Blackwood Contracts — Full Overview

## Premise & Stakes

The Blackwood March is dying. Over the past year, monster attacks have escalated from occasional wilderness threats to coordinated assaults on settlements. Three villages have been wiped out. Trade routes are closed. The ruling nobility, House Blackwood, seems paralyzed by indecision.

Into this chaos steps the Order of the Silver Chain, a guild of professional monster hunters. They've put out an emergency call for capable investigators, and you answered. Your first contract seems straightforward: investigate the massacre at Rivermeet Manor, where an entire wedding party was slaughtered and something unnatural fled into the woods.

But as you follow the trail of claw marks and alchemical residue, you'll uncover a conspiracy that runs deeper than anyone suspected. These monsters aren't natural—they're being created. And whoever is making them has a purpose far darker than simple terror.

Your investigation will take you from blood-soaked farmsteads to corrupt noble estates, from ancient elven ruins to a mad alchemist's laboratory. You'll track chimeric beasts through haunted forests, interrogate witnesses who saw impossible things, and research forbidden lore to understand your prey.

And at the end of the hunt, you'll face a choice: How far will you go to stop the monsters? Will you remain human? Or will you embrace the very corruption you're fighting to gain the power needed to win?

**The stakes:** If the heroes fail, the Hollow Sovereign—a primordial entity of emptiness and hunger—will break free from its ancient prison and consume not just the Blackwood March, but reality itself in an ever-expanding zone of annihilation.

## Act Outline

### Act I: The Pattern Emerges (Sessions 1-8, Levels 1-3)

**Crisis:** Unnatural monsters are attacking settlements across the Blackwood March with increasing frequency and intelligence. The Order of the Silver Chain is overwhelmed, and the local nobility refuses to acknowledge the scope of the threat.

**Reversal:** The monsters aren't natural—they're being artificially created by a rogue alchemist named Dr. Erasmus Venn. But Venn isn't acting alone; he's being sponsored by powerful patrons within House Blackwood's court.

#### Key Scenes & Contracts:

- Level 3: After defeating Venn's masterpiece and discovering the Quorum connection

---

### Act II: The Conspiracy Unveiled (Sessions 9-16, Levels 4-6)

**Crisis:** The threat isn't just monsters—it's a conspiracy within the nobility itself. The Crimson Quorum has infiltrated House Blackwood and is using Venn's creations for a planned coup. But stopping them means navigating deadly court politics where heroes can't just draw swords.

**Reversal:** The coup succeeds, but it was never the real goal—just a distraction. The Quorum's true purpose is revealed: awakening an ancient entity called the Hollow Sovereign by feeding it a feast of death and despair.

#### Key Scenes & Contracts:

**Contract 7: The Gilded Cage (Session 9)**
- Lady Mira Blackwood (reformist noble) hires heroes privately
- Someone is targeting her allies at court; two have "mysteriously" died

- Stealth-infiltration mission to gather intelligence
- Discover Quorum roster, meeting notes about "the Sovereign's awakening"
- Optional: Steal Quorum member list or confront one member (consequences either way)

**Contract 9: The Corrupted Grove (Session 11)**

- Clue: Garrett's journals reference "the Sovereign grants strength to those who embrace the void"

**Interlude: The Storm Gathers (Session 13)**
- Heroes present evidence to Lord Blackwood
- Political standoff: Blackwood wants to act cautiously; Quorum learns they're exposed
- Quorum accelerates their timeline
- Master Jorah assigns heroes to protect key loyalist nobles

**The Coup (Sessions 14-15)**

- Lord Blackwood assassinated; several loyalist nobles killed or captured
- Monsters unleashed throughout Thornhaven (multiple simultaneous encounters)

**Contract 11: Picking Up the Pieces (Session 16)**
- Thornhaven in chaos; new regent (Lady Mira) needs help restoring order
- Investigation of Morth's estate reveals his true plan via recovered journals
- Discovery: Coup was a distraction; real goal is ritual at the Sundered Sanctum to free the Hollow Sovereign

**Level Progression:**
- Level 4: After exposing the Crimson Estate
- Level 5: After stopping the coup
- Level 6: After discovering Morth's true plan

---

### Act III: Into the Blackwood (Sessions 17-22, Levels 7-9)

**Crisis:** Hadrian Morth has fled into the deep Blackwood Forest to reach the Sundered Sanctum, where the Hollow Sovereign is imprisoned. The heroes must venture into the corrupted wilderness and stop him before he completes the ritual.

**Reversal:** Even if they stop Morth, the Sovereign has already tasted reality through the blood shed during the coup. The ancient seals are weakening, and the entity is pulling itself into the world. The heroes must find a way to repair or reinforce the prison—but doing so may require monstrous sacrifices.

#### Key Scenes & Contracts:

**The Journey Begins (Session 17)**
- Preparation montage: Research the Sovereign, gather supplies, recruit allies
- Optional: Dr. Venn offers to help; he's remorseful but can heroes trust him?

**Level Progression:**

- Level 8: After clearing most of the Sundered Sanctum
- Level 9: After disrupting Morth's ritual

---

### Act IV: The Hollow Crown (Sessions 23-30, Levels 9-10)

**Crisis:** The Hollow Sovereign is partially manifested and cannot be fully resealed without re-performing the ancient elven rite. Hadrian Morth, now fully corrupted, serves the Sovereign willingly and commands an army of void-touched thralls. The heroes must gather the components for the counter-ritual while reality itself collapses around them.

**Reversal:** The ritual requires a willing sacrifice—someone must take the Sovereign back into themselves and become a new prison. Or the heroes can find another way, but it will leave the Blackwood March scarred forever.

#### Key Scenes & Contracts:

**Contract 15: The Ritual Components (Sessions 23-24)**
- To re-seal the Sovereign, heroes need components from the very monsters they've hunted
- Must revisit previous contract locations or track down new specimens
- Ironic twist: Must use "monstrous" solutions (chimeric organs, ghoul essences, etc.)
- Encounters: Remnant monsters from earlier contracts have grown stronger

**Contract 16: The Ally's Bargain (Session 25)**
- Need powerful magical assistance; must choose an ally
- Options: Greenwardens (if allied earlier), Order of the Silver Chain, or even Dr. Venn
- Each ally has a price: Greenwardens want Thornhaven to abandon expansion; Order wants heroes to join permanently; Venn wants forgiveness
- Choice affects available resources and epilogue

**The Hollow Sovereign Rises (Sessions 26-28)**
- Major dungeon finale: Heart of the Sanctum, where prison is breaking
- Environmental challenge: Reality is collapsing; zones shift between past/present/void
- Encounters: Void-touched versions of previous enemies; heroes face their own fears manifested
- Corruption temptation: Sovereign offers heroes power if they serve it
- Optional: PCs who took corruption abilities can resist or fall

**Boss Fight: Hadrian Morth, the Void Speaker (Session 28)**
- Multi-phase fight: Morth with grafted monster parts, then void-touched form, then fused with Sovereign's avatar
- Mechanics: Reality distortion effects, fear auras, time manipulation
- Defeating Morth weakens Sovereign but doesn't seal it

**The Sealing Ritual (Session 29)**
- Heroes must perform counter-ritual while Sovereign tries to stop them
- Skill challenge: Each PC contributes using their specialties
- Choice: Who sacrifices themselves (PC, NPC ally, or find alternative solution)?
- Alternative solution: Imprison Sovereign but requires ongoing vigilance (hooks for future campaigns)

**Epilogue & Consequences (Session 30)**
- Immediate aftermath: Who survived? Who was changed?
- Thornhaven's response: Heroes celebrated or feared?
- Faction fates: Order's future, House Blackwood's stability, Quorum remnants
- Character epilogues: Where do heroes go from here?
- Optional: Seeds for continuation (other Quorum cells, more primordial entities, corruption consequences)

**Level Progression:**
- Level 10: After defeating Hadrian Morth and deciding the Sovereign's fate

## Character Hooks

Choose one or work with your GM to create a custom hook:

### 1. Guild Initiate
You recently joined the Order of the Silver Chain after hearing tales of their monster-hunting exploits. You see this assignment as your proving ground—succeed, and you'll earn full membership and respect. Fail, and you'll be relegated to desk work cataloging bestiaries.

**Connection:** Master Jorah is your sponsor; you want to impress him  
**Mechanical Hook:** Gain +1 circumstance bonus to Research checks about monsters when using Order resources  
**Narrative Hook:** Access to Order library and contacts from Session 1

### 2. Survivor's Oath
A monster attack destroyed your home—village, family, or both. You've dedicated your life to hunting the creatures responsible and preventing others from suffering the same fate. When you heard about the escalating attacks in Blackwood March, you knew you had to help.

**Connection:** One of the early monster attacks mirrors what happened to you  
**Mechanical Hook:** Once per session, reroll a failed save against a monster's ability (must take second result)  
**Narrative Hook:** Personal stakes in stopping the attacks; revenge subplot against specific monster type

### 3. Scholar of the Unnatural
You studied at a prestigious academy (Absalom, Korvosa, etc.) focusing on magical creatures, aberrations, and the planes. You came to the March seeking rare specimens to research—but these new monsters don't match any known taxonomy. Understanding what they are has become an obsession.

**Connection:** You recognize the alchemical techniques Venn is using from theoretical research  
**Mechanical Hook:** Gain +1 circumstance bonus to Recall Knowledge checks about monsters  
**Narrative Hook:** Can identify clues others miss; Venn may try to recruit you

### 4. Noble's Retainer
You serve (or served) House Blackwood as guard, advisor, or agent. You've seen troubling signs that someone within the nobility is involved in the attacks, and you're investigating discreetly. Your loyalty is to the March and its people, not corrupt nobles.

**Connection:** You have access to noble court; Lady Mira may know you  
**Mechanical Hook:** Gain +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy and Society checks when dealing with nobility  
**Narrative Hook:** Inside knowledge of House Blackwood; potential target of Quorum

### 5. Haunted Hunter
You survived an encounter with something unnatural years ago, but it left you changed—nightmares, strange intuitions about monsters, or a supernatural mark. You hunt because something compels you to. Sometimes you know things you shouldn't. Sometimes you feel the monsters before you see them.

**Connection:** You sense the Sovereign's presence from the beginning  
**Mechanical Hook:** Once per session, the GM gives you a cryptic vision/premonition about upcoming danger  
**Narrative Hook:** Optional corruption mechanics tie-in; mysterious personal subplot; Sovereign may speak to you

### 6. Outsider Specialist
You're from elsewhere (Tian Xia, Mwangi Expanse, Varisia) and have expertise in dealing with monsters your homeland faces. You came to the March as a consultant, hired for your unique perspective. You're not familiar with local politics, which makes you both valuable (unbiased) and vulnerable (no allies).

**Connection:** You bring knowledge from outside the March  
**Mechanical Hook:** Once per session, apply lore from your homeland to gain advantage on a check  
**Narrative Hook:** Fresh perspective on clues; can question local assumptions

## Living World Rules

The Blackwood March is a living setting. If heroes don't actively pursue the main plot, the world continues without them—sometimes successfully, sometimes catastrophically.

### Act I: If Heroes Ignore the Pattern
- **After 2 Sessions:** Venn creates more monsters; another village destroyed; +1 to "Monstrous Incursions" clock
- **At 6/6 Monstrous Incursions:** Trade routes close; refugees flood Thornhaven; martial law declared; heroes' contract pay increases but difficulty spikes

### Act II: If Heroes Don't Investigate the Quorum
- **After 2 Sessions:** Quorum consolidates power; another noble dies "mysteriously"; +1 to "Coup Preparation" clock
- **At 4/4 Coup Preparation:** Coup triggers early (heroes unprepared); Lord Blackwood dies; Lady Mira may die too; Thornhaven falls into chaos

### Act III: If Heroes Delay Pursuing Morth
- **After Each Session:** Sovereign's influence spreads; corrupted zones expand; +1 to "Reality Decay" clock
- **At 8/8 Reality Decay:** Point of no return; March becomes void-touched wasteland; heroes must sacrifice themselves to seal Sovereign

### NPC Independent Actions
- **Master Jorah:** Will mobilize Order to fight monsters even without heroes; may die heroically
- **Lady Mira:** Will attempt political solutions; may be assassinated by Quorum
- **Constable Kael:** Will investigate corruption alone; likely to be killed
- **Old Meg:** Will hide and survive; offers refuge if heroes need it
- **Dr. Venn:** Will continue creating monsters (if not stopped) or seek redemption (if confronted)
- **Hadrian Morth:** Will advance ritual relentlessly; success depends on hero interference

### Faction Interactions
- If heroes ally with **Greenwardens**, they may sabotage Quorum (helpful) but also attack Thornhaven expansion (complication)
- If **Order of the Silver Chain** reputation falls too low, members desert; guild may splinter
- If **House Blackwood** stability falls to 0, neighboring baronies invade (new enemies during final act)

## Content Warnings & Safety Tools

### Lines (Will Not Appear On-Screen)
- Sexual violence
- Harm to children on-screen (referenced only in past tense, never shown)
- Player character permanent mind control without player consent

### Veils (Described Briefly Then Fade-to-Black)
- Graphic torture (describe setup, cut away, show aftermath)
- Body horror transformations (describe before/after, not the process)
- Mass civilian casualties (aftermath only; numbers, not graphic details)

### Ask First (Discuss With Players Before Introducing)
- **Optional Corruption Mechanics:** Characters can gain monster-themed powers (enhanced abilities, new traits) but risk losing their humanity if they go too far. This is purely optional and requires player buy-in.
- **Permanent Disfigurement:** Certain curses or monster attacks may cause permanent scars, missing limbs, or other lasting changes. Always telegraph this possibility and allow player choice.
- **Character Death:** While the campaign is dangerous, "death trap" scenarios will be clearly telegraphed. Players will have narrative warning before truly lethal situations.

### Safety Protocol
- **X-Card:** Any player (including GM) can tap the X-card to skip/edit content, no questions asked
- **Script Change:** Players can "rewind" (redo a scene), "fast-forward" (skip ahead), or "pause" (take a break)
- **Open Door Policy:** Players can leave the table any time, no explanation needed; we'll check in after session
- **Check-Ins:** GM will ask "Everyone still good?" before intense scenes and after sessions

### Handling Sensitive Content
- **Monster Violence:** Described tactically (claw attack, bite) not gorily; focus on heroics, not suffering
- **Conspiracy Horror:** Emphasis on investigation/revelation tension, not graphic descriptions of Quorum's experiments
- **Corruption Themes:** Focus on moral choices and consequences, not graphic transformation body horror
- **Mass Tragedy:** When villages are destroyed, focus on survivors' resilience and heroes' response, not graphic casualties

---

## Optional Corruption Mechanics

**Design Intent:** Allow players to explore "becoming the monster" theme if they want, without forcing it on anyone.

### How It Works
- When heroes defeat certain monsters, they can choose to absorb/bind aspects of that monster's power
- Each corruption provides a mechanical benefit but also a narrative cost
- Track corruption on a scale of 0-5; at 5, character becomes NPC (fully transformed)
- Corruption can be resisted with save (Will DC increases each time) or cleansed with downtime ritual

### Example Corruptions

**Ghoul Hunger (Corruption 1)**
- **Benefit:** Gain +2 bonus to attack rolls when you haven't eaten in 24 hours (metabolic efficiency)
- **Cost:** Must eat double rations or become fatigued; disturbing hunger pangs
- **Appearance:** Skin becomes pale and waxy; eyes sunken

**Chimeric Reflexes (Corruption 2)**
- **Benefit:** Gain additional Reaction each round (wolf head watches your back)
- **Cost:** Occasionally lose control and act on instinct (GM calls for Will save in stressful moments)
- **Appearance:** Extra eyes appear on back of head; spine slightly misshapen

**Phase Step (Corruption 3)**
- **Benefit:** Once per day, teleport 30 feet as 2-action activity (phase spider ability)
- **Cost:** Sometimes phase partially (5% chance per phase); vulnerable to disruption
- **Appearance:** Skin becomes slightly translucent; casts double shadows

**Void Gaze (Corruption 4)**
- **Benefit:** 1/day, target must save vs. fear or be paralyzed (witness the Sovereign)
- **Cost:** Hear Sovereign's whispers; must save vs. Will each day or act on its suggestions
- **Appearance:** Eyes become black voids; skin cold to touch

**Full Transformation (Corruption 5)**
- **Character becomes NPC:** Player and GM collaborate on what creature they become
- **Epilogue:** Character may appear as later boss fight, or redemption quest for party
- **New Character:** Player creates new PC; perhaps one seeking to save their old character

### Cleansing Corruption
- **Downtime Ritual:** Requires priest/druid, 1 week, 100 gp per corruption level; Will save DC 15 + (corruption level × 5)
- **Quest-Based:** Find sacred relic, perform pilgrimage, earn forgiveness from deity
- **Sacrifice:** Give up something precious (ability score, magical item, relationship) to purge corruption

## GM Guidance: Running Investigations

**The Monster Hunting Cycle (Core Gameplay Loop)**

Each contract follows this structure:

### 1. Investigate (Session Opening)
- **Goal:** Gather clues about monster's nature, location, and weaknesses
- **Activities:** Interview witnesses, examine crime scenes, research lore
- **GM's Job:** Provide fair clues regardless of dice rolls; reward clever questions and thorough searching
- **Key Clue Rule:** Players always find critical information (what monster it is); dice determine how much extra they learn

### 2. Research (Downtime or Mid-Session)
- **Goal:** Identify monster's vulnerabilities and tactics
- **Activities:** Consult Order library, talk to Old Meg, recall previous hunts
- **GM's Job:** Provide accurate information about monster; hint at weaknesses
- **Failure State:** Heroes go in blind; higher difficulty but still possible

### 3. Prepare (Before Hunt)
- **Goal:** Craft specialized gear, set traps, choose terrain
- **Activities:** Alchemical crafting, planning ambushes, gathering allies
- **GM's Job:** Let preparation matter mechanically; reduce encounter difficulty if heroes prep well
- **Reward:** Circumstance bonuses, advantage on initiative, environmental control

### 4. Hunt (Combat Encounter)
- **Goal:** Defeat or drive off monster using gathered knowledge
- **Activities:** Combat with tactical advantages from preparation
- **GM's Job:** Run monster intelligently but fairly; exploit weaknesses heroes found; allow creative solutions
- **Alternative Solutions:** Negotiation, traps, rituals, driving it away (doesn't always mean killing)

### 5. Resolve (Session Closing)
- **Goal:** Deal with aftermath, collect payment, connect clues to larger mystery
- **Activities:** Report to guild, interview survivors again, examine monster corpse
- **GM's Job:** Provide closure and hook for next mystery; reward players with XP, treasure, and story progression

**Pacing Tips**
- **Single-Session Contracts:** Simple monster hunts (Acts I-II early)
- **Multi-Session Contracts:** Complex mysteries requiring multiple investigation sites (Acts II-III)
- **Parallel Investigations:** Heroes juggle active contract + conspiracy research (Act II)

**Clue Provision**
- **Core Clue:** Always provided; necessary to progress (what monster, where it is)
- **Helpful Clues:** Provided with successful checks; make hunt easier (weaknesses, tactics)
- **Bonus Clues:** Reward creative thinking; connect to larger conspiracy

**Failure Handling**
- **Failed Investigation Check:** Heroes still learn something, just not everything (or it takes longer)
- **Failed Hunt:** Monster escapes; attacks again later; heroes learn from failure
- **Failed Preparation:** Combat is harder but not impossible; consequences teach importance of prep

- **Bloodborne (Video Game):** Gothic horror aesthetic; insight into madness; corruption mechanics
- **Monster Hunter (Video Game Series):** Research monsters; craft specialized gear; tactical preparation

### Film/TV
- **True Detective (Season 1):** Slow-burn investigation; uncovering conspiracy; dark tone
- **The Ritual (Film):** Folk horror in deep woods; ancient entity; isolation and dread
- **Hannibal (TV Series):** Elegant horror; investigative process; moral complexity

### Tabletop
- **Pathfinder 2E: Abomination Vaults:** Dungeon delve structure; escalating threat

## Quick Reference: Key Questions Players Should Ask

**At Crime Scenes:**
- What tracks/marks did the creature leave?
- Are there any unusual substances (blood, residue, etc.)?
- What time did the attack occur? Any patterns?
- Who was targeted—specific people or random?

**When Interviewing Witnesses:**
- What exactly did they see/hear?
- Did the creature seem intelligent or bestial?
- Have there been other similar incidents?
- Who benefits from this attack?

**During Research:**
- What creatures match this description?
- What are this creature's weaknesses?
- How intelligent is it—can it be reasoned with?
- Where would it lair?

**Before the Hunt:**
- What gear/potions/spells would exploit its weaknesses?
- What terrain gives us advantage?
- Can we set a trap or ambush?
- Do we need allies for this?

## Ending Options & Epilogues

**Campaign can end multiple ways depending on player choices:**

### Heroic Victory
- Sovereign sealed; heroes sacrifice nothing personal (but maybe allies do)
- Blackwood March saved; begins recovery
- Heroes celebrated as saviors
- **Epilogue Options:** Retire wealthy and famous, lead Order, govern March with Lady Mira

### Pyrrhic Victory
- Sovereign sealed but at great cost (PC death, corruption, destroyed land)
- March saved but scarred forever
- Heroes are traumatized but alive
- **Epilogue Options:** Retire haunted, guard Sovereign's prison, hunt remaining Quorum cells

### Dark Victory
- Sovereign sealed by becoming new prison (PC volunteers)
- March saved; sacrificed hero becomes legend
- Remaining PCs must live with survivor's guilt
- **Epilogue Options:** Guard the prison, honor fallen hero, prevent future threats

### Compromise Ending
- Sovereign partially sealed but not destroyed
- Must maintain ongoing vigilance (ritual every decade)
- March permanently changed (magic is strange now)
- **Epilogue Options:** Found order to guard prison, research better solution, explore changed world

### Failure (If Awakening Clock Hits 8/8)
- Sovereign manifests; begins consuming March
- Heroes can still fight rear-guard action to evacuate civilians
- Becomes apocalypse campaign—stop Sovereign from spreading beyond March
- **Epilogue Options:** Exile heroes lead survivors, find way to reclaim March later, tragic but memorable end

**Regardless of ending, provide:**
- Individual character epilogues (what happens to each PC)
- NPC fates (who survived, who rose to power, who fell)
- World state (how March changes)
- Seeds for future campaigns (other Quorum cells, more primordials, PC's children continue legacy)
