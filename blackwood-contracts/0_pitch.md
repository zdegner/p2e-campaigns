# The Blackwood Contracts — Pitch

**Elevator Pitch:**

You are contract monster hunters in the frontier region of Blackwood March—a wild land where civilization's edge meets dark forests and forgotten ruins. Strange creatures have been attacking villages with increasing frequency and cunning. Your guild, the Order of the Silver Chain, dispatches you to investigate, track, and eliminate these threats. But as you follow the contracts deeper into the March, you uncover a horrifying pattern: these monsters are not natural. Someone is creating them, experimenting with forbidden magic to birth nightmares into the world. Your hunt will take you from isolated farmsteads to corrupt noble estates, from ancient elvish ruins to a mad alchemist's laboratory—and ultimately to confront the architect of this monstrous conspiracy before the entire March becomes a domain of endless horror.

**Why now?**

The attacks have escalated from isolated incidents to coordinated strikes. Three villages have been destroyed in the past month. The local nobility seems unable—or unwilling—to act. The Order of the Silver Chain, a small but growing guild of monster hunters, has put out an urgent call for capable investigators. You answered that call, arriving in the March's capital of Thornhaven just as the next contract comes in: an entire wedding party slaughtered at a riverside manor, and something unnatural was seen fleeing into the woods.

**Player Promises (what you'll get):**

- **Mystery and Investigation:** Each monster contract is a detective story—gather clues from victims, study tracks and remains, research lore, and deduce your quarry's nature before hunting it
- **Strategic Monster Hunting:** Preparation matters—identify weaknesses, craft specialized weapons/potions, set ambushes, and exploit environments to level the playing field
- **Moral Complexity:** Not every monster deserves death; some are victims, others can be reasoned with, and sometimes the "monster" is human
- **Exploration:** Track creatures through haunted forests, abandoned villages, underground caverns, and noble estates hiding dark secrets
- **Escalating Stakes:** Start with isolated beast attacks, escalate to uncovering a conspiracy, culminate in preventing a ritual that could doom the entire region
- **Player Agency:** Multiple solutions to each contract—combat, negotiation, research/ritual, stealth, or creative thinking

**Table Expectations:**

- **Tone:** Dark heroic with investigative elements; grim but not hopeless; horror elements present but heroes can make a difference
- **Safety:** 
  - **Lines (will not appear):** Sexual violence, harm to children on-screen, player character mind control lasting more than one scene
  - **Veils (described briefly then fade-to-black):** Graphic torture, body horror transformations, mass civilian casualties
  - **Ask First:** Character corruption mechanics (optional path to gain monster powers at a cost), permanent disfigurement from curses
- **Advancement:** Milestone (level up after completing major story beats, approximately every 2-3 sessions)
- **Session Length:** 3-4 hours per session
- **Expected Campaign Length:** 25-30 sessions (approximately 6-9 months of weekly play)
- **Complexity:** Standard (each scene has 2-3 approaches; contingencies for creative solutions)
- **Combat Ratio:** Medium (about 40% combat, 35% investigation/exploration, 25% social interaction)
- **Map Style:** Hybrid (theater-of-the-mind for investigation/travel, tactical grid for complex combat encounters)

**Character Hooks (tie PCs to the story):**

Choose one or collaborate with your GM to create your own:

1. **Guild Initiate:** You recently joined the Order of the Silver Chain and see this as your chance to prove yourself worthy of full membership. (Connects you to NPCs Master Jorah and the Order)

2. **Survivor:** A monster attack destroyed your home village/family. You've dedicated your life to hunting the creatures responsible and preventing others from suffering the same fate. (Personal stakes in stopping the attacks)

3. **Scholar of the Unnatural:** You studied at an academy focused on magical creatures and aberrations. You came to the March seeking rare specimens to research—but these new monsters don't match any known taxonomy. (Hooks into the mystery of artificial monster creation)

4. **Noble's Retainer:** You serve (or served) House Blackwood, the March's ruling family. You've seen troubling signs that someone within the nobility is involved in the attacks, and you're investigating discreetly. (Access to noble society, insider knowledge)

5. **Haunted Hunter:** You survived an encounter with something unnatural years ago, but it left you changed—nightmares, strange intuitions about monsters, or a supernatural mark. You hunt because something compels you to. (Optional corruption mechanics tie-in; mysterious personal subplot)

6. **Outsider Specialist:** You're from elsewhere (another nation, another culture) and have expertise in dealing with monsters your homeland faces. You came to the March to study its unique creatures or answer a call for help. (Fresh perspective; can explain PF2e mechanics as "how we do it where I'm from")

**Session Zero Checklist:**

- [ ] Discuss Lines & Veils; agree on safety protocols (X-Card, Script Change, Open Door policy)
- [ ] Review character hooks; integrate into backstories and establish connections between PCs (how do you know each other?)
- [ ] Set expectations for investigation gameplay (note-taking, player-driven questions, GM won't hand-hold but will provide fair clues)
- [ ] Establish table norms (phones, food, scheduling, what happens if someone misses a session)
- [ ] Confirm party composition and mechanical assumptions (free archetype variant? any house rules?)
- [ ] Preview tone and themes (show reference art: Witcher games, Bloodborne, folk horror films)
- [ ] Discuss character mortality and consequences (this is a dangerous campaign; heroes can die, but you'll have narrative warning before "death trap" situations)
- [ ] Introduce the "Monster Hunting Cycle" gameplay loop: Investigate → Research → Prepare → Hunt → Resolve
- [ ] Optional: Introduce "Corruption" mechanics (can gain monster-themed powers but risk losing your character to transformation if you go too far)
- [ ] Build shared expectations for "investigation success"—GM will provide clues if players ask good questions and search smart locations, even if dice rolls fail

**Recommended Character Options:**

While any character can thrive in this campaign, consider options that support investigation, wilderness survival, or monster lore:

- **Classes:** Investigator (obvious fit), Ranger (tracking/survival), Alchemist (crafting monster-specific reagents), Champion/Cleric (protection/healing), Rogue (stealth/skills), Wizard/Witch (knowledge/utility magic)
- **Skills:** Nature, Occultism, Medicine, Society, Crafting, Survival, Diplomacy (for interviewing witnesses), Intimidation (for interrogations)
- **Backgrounds:** Herbalist, Scholar, Detective, Hunter, Emissary, Monster Hunter, Charlatan (undercover), Former Criminal (knows the underworld)

**What Players Should Know:**

- This campaign rewards **investigation and preparation** more than direct combat; charging into fights unprepared may get you killed
- **Taking notes** and connecting clues across sessions is important; you may encounter mysteries that span multiple contracts
- The world **continues without you**—if you ignore contracts or threats, they will escalate; faction clocks advance
- Not every problem has a combat solution; sometimes **negotiation, research, or clever thinking** is the answer
- You are **competent professionals**, not hapless villagers; the GM will challenge you but respects your expertise
