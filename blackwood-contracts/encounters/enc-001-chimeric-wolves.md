# Encounter: ENC-001 — Chimeric Wolf Pack

**Session:** 01  
**Location:** Collapsed Barn near Rivermeet  
**Party Level:** 1  
**Severity:** Moderate

## Objective

Defeat or drive off the chimeric wolves responsible for the Rivermeet massacre before they attack again.

**Success looks like:** Wolves eliminated or permanently driven from the area; heroes can examine corpses for clues about Dr. Venn's work.

## Environment

**Terrain Traits:**
- **Difficult Terrain:** Interior of barn has rubble, rotting wood, collapsed beams
- **Cover:** Partial cover from broken walls and farm equipment
- **Concealment:** Dim light (overcast day + forest canopy); shadows in barn corners

**Hazards:**
- **Rotting Floorboards:** Reflex DC 15 when moving more than 1 action's worth of movement; failure = fall prone
- **Unstable Ceiling:** If area effect spells used, 10% chance per spell of ceiling collapse (3d6 bludgeoning, Reflex DC 15 half, affects 10-foot square)

**Chokepoints:**
- Barn has single large door (10 feet wide) and small window (5 feet, requires Squeeze)
- Wolves can't easily flank if heroes control doorway

**Elevations:**
- Hayloft accessible via rickety ladder (Athletics DC 13); provides height advantage (+2 circumstance to ranged attacks down)

**Lighting:** Dim (no penalties for creatures with low-light vision)

## Budget & Composition

**Party:** 4 characters, level 1  
**Target Severity:** Moderate  
**XP Budget:** 80 XP (moderate threat)

### Creatures/Hazards:

- **Chimeric Wolf** (Level 0 creature, 10 XP) × 3 = **30 XP each = 90 XP total**

**Note:** This is technically Moderate-High (90 vs 80 budget), which is intentional—first real combat should be challenging but fair.

### Creature Stats: Chimeric Wolf

**Use base Wolf stats (Bestiary p. 334) with these modifications:**

- **HP:** 24 (instead of 20)
- **Special Ability — Two Heads:** Gains scent (imprecise 30 feet); +2 circumstance bonus to Perception to avoid flanking
- **Special Ability — Alchemical Enhancement:** When reduced to 0 HP, must make Fortitude save (DC 15); on success, remains at 1 HP and becomes enraged (+2 damage, -1 AC) until end of next turn
- **Appearance:** Each wolf has two heads (side-by-side); surgical scars visible; eyes show unnatural intelligence

**Tactics:**
- Wolves use pack tactics: attempt to flank whenever possible
- Primary attack: Bite + Trip combo (if trip succeeds, allies attack prone target)
- If 2+ wolves drop below half HP, alpha (pick one) attempts to flee; others cover retreat
- If cornered, fight to death (alchemical programming overrides survival instinct)

### Severity Check:

For 4 × level-1 PCs, Moderate encounter = 60-90 XP  
This encounter's 90 XP = upper end of Moderate (appropriate for first major combat)

### Scaling Notes:

**For 3 PCs:**
- Remove 1 wolf (60 XP total = Moderate)

**For 5 PCs:**
- Add 1 wolf (120 XP total = Severe) OR
- Upgrade one wolf to "Alpha" using Elite template (+2 AC, +2 attacks, +1 damage, +4 HP) = 100 XP total (Moderate-High)

**For 6 PCs:**
- Add 2 wolves (150 XP total = Severe)

## Skill Alternatives

Heroes can reduce difficulty or avoid combat with clever use of skills:

### Pre-Combat:

**Survival DC 17:** Set snare/trap at barn entrance before wolves notice  
- **Effect:** First wolf to emerge triggers trap for 2d6 piercing damage (no save)

**Nature DC 19:** Recognize wolf feeding pattern; predict movement; circle to ambush from behind  
- **Effect:** Party gets surprise round

**Stealth DC 18 (group check):** Approach within 30 feet unnoticed  
- **Effect:** Party can open with ranged attacks/spells before initiative

### During Combat:

**Intimidation DC 20 (requires visible threat—fire, magic, loud noise):** Scare wolves into retreating  
- **Effect:** Wolves flee; combat ends (heroes still gain full XP)

**Crafting DC 15 (alchemist's fire or similar):** Exploit wolves' fear of fire  
- **Effect:** Wolves take -2 circumstance penalty to attacks while fire is visible; will not move adjacent to fire source

**Athletics DC 18:** Collapse barn doorway onto wolves  
- **Effect:** 3d6 bludgeoning to all wolves in 10-foot square, Reflex DC 15 half; creates difficult terrain

### Post-Combat:

**Medicine DC 15:** Examine wolf corpses; identify surgical scars and alchemical organs  
- **Effect:** Confirms they're artificially created; provides samples worth 5 gp each

**Crafting (Alchemy) DC 17:** Harvest alchemical enhancement organs intact  
- **Effect:** Gain 3 doses of "Chimeric Extract" (can be sold for 10 gp or used in crafting)

**Nature DC 17:** Track wolves back to previous lair (not this barn—an older den)  
- **Effect:** Find evidence of earlier kills; torn fabric with noble seal (clue for future contract)

## Consequences

### Victory

**Immediate:**
- Wolves defeated or permanently driven off
- Rivermeet area is safe
- Heroes can examine corpses for evidence

**Rewards:**
- Contract payment: 20 gp per PC + 50 gp party bonus (from Constable Maren and Rivermeet survivors)
- Guild Reputation +1
- Salvageable parts: 3× Chimeric Extract (10 gp value each) or 9× Alchemical Organs (5 gp each)

**Story Progress:**
- Confirms Dr. Venn's work is artificial monster creation
- Provides physical evidence of surgical enhancement
- Clue found in lair (torn fabric) leads to future contract

### Partial (Some Wolves Escape)

**Immediate:**
- 1-2 wolves flee into deep forest
- Area is safer but not secure

**Rewards:**
- Reduced payment: 15 gp per PC + 25 gp party bonus
- Guild Reputation +0 (no change)
- Limited salvage (1-2 samples)

**Consequences:**
- Escaped wolves will attack again in 1d4 days (different target)
- Heroes may be called back to finish job

### Failure (Heroes Retreat)

**Immediate:**
- Wolves retain control of area
- Rivermeet remains under threat

**Rewards:**
- No payment (contract incomplete)
- Guild Reputation -1
- No salvage

**Consequences:**
- Wolves attack another location within 24 hours
- Master Jorah questions heroes' readiness; may assign easier contract next
- Rivermeet hires different hunters (NPC rivals succeed, gain reputation)

## Treasure

**Loot Found in Barn (After Combat):**

- **Mundane:** Torn fabric with embroidered noble seal (clue; worth 5 gp to collector)
- **Alchemical:** Chimeric Extract samples (see above)
- **Evidence:** Surgical tools left behind (worth 10 gp; proves surgical modification)

**Total Treasure Value:** ~70-90 gp (between payment + salvage), appropriate for level 1 party

## GM Notes

**Running This Encounter:**

1. **Telegraph Danger:** Describe smell of wet fur, low growls before combat starts; give heroes 1 round to prepare
2. **Use Terrain:** Wolves should try to lure heroes into difficult terrain; use Pack Attack to flank
3. **Tactical Wolves:** These aren't mindless beasts—they're enhanced with intelligence; have them coordinate targets
4. **Escape Option:** If combat goes badly, allow heroes to retreat; wolves don't pursue beyond barn (territorial programming)
5. **Reward Creativity:** If heroes use fire, traps, or other clever tactics, narrate how effective it is; make them feel smart

**Pacing:**
- This is first major combat; should take 30-45 minutes
- If running long, have 1-2 wolves flee early (reduces enemy count)
- If too easy, have wolves use Pack Attack more aggressively

**Connection to Campaign:**
- This encounter establishes Dr. Venn's capabilities (surgical enhancement + alchemical boosting)
- Foreshadows larger conspiracy (why create killer wolves?)
- Provides physical evidence heroes can analyze later
