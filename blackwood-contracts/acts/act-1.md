# Act I: The Pattern Emerges

**Sessions:** 1-8  
**Party Level:** 1-3  
**Primary Locations:** Thornhaven, Farmlands, Outer Blackwood Forest  
**Central Mystery:** Who is creating these monsters, and why?

## Act Summary

The heroes arrive in Thornhaven and join the Order of the Silver Chain just as monster attacks across the Blackwood March escalate. What begins as routine contract work—hunting chimeric wolves, stopping plague outbreaks, banishing ghosts—reveals a disturbing pattern: these threats are artificial, created by someone with access to advanced alchemy and necromancy.

By tracking alchemical signatures, interviewing witnesses, and investigating crime scenes, the heroes identify the creator: Dr. Erasmus Venn, a brilliant but misguided alchemist. When they finally confront Venn at his primary laboratory (the Old Grainery Mill), they discover he's not working alone—he's being sponsored by the "Crimson Quorum," a secret society with ties to House Blackwood's court.

The act ends with Venn escaping and dropping evidence that implicates Lord Treasurer Hadrian Morth, one of the most powerful nobles in the March. The heroes realize the threat isn't just monsters—it's a conspiracy reaching into the highest levels of power.

## Story Arc

### Inciting Incident (Session 1)
Rivermeet Manor massacre: An entire wedding party is slaughtered by chimeric wolves with human intelligence. Heroes are hired to investigate.

### Rising Action (Sessions 2-6)
- **Contract 2 (Session 2):** Millford village poisoned with Whispering Sickness plague; heroes discover it was deliberately introduced
- **Contract 3 (Session 3):** Phantom Bride haunting Iron Bridge is a bound spirit, weaponized to disrupt trade
- **Interlude (Session 4):** Formal induction into Order; access to resources; research montage
- **Contract 4 (Session 5):** Phase spider hunting specific noble bloodline; magically programmed with targets
- **Contract 5 (Session 6):** Otyugh variants in Thornhaven sewers lead to black market connections
- **Pattern Recognition:** All contracts show same alchemical signature; references to "Dr. V" and "the Quorum"

### Crisis (Session 7)
Heroes track Venn to his primary laboratory at the Old Grainery Mill. Confrontation reveals he's creating monsters under commission from the Crimson Quorum.

### Reversal (Session 8)
Venn escapes but drops evidence implicating Lord Treasurer Hadrian Morth. Heroes now face a political conspiracy—they can't just fight monsters; they must navigate noble intrigue and gather proof against powerful enemies.

## Key Themes

**Knowledge is Power:**
- Heroes must investigate before hunting; understanding prey is survival
- Research provides tactical advantages
- Evidence-gathering is as important as combat prowess

**Professional Competence:**
- Heroes are skilled monster hunters, not bumbling amateurs
- The Order provides structure and support
- Contracts teach the "hunting cycle": investigate → research → prepare → hunt → resolve

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Seemingly unrelated attacks connect to larger conspiracy
- Small clues (alchemical residue, journal fragments, witness testimony) build the picture
- Mystery drives the campaign forward

## Clue Trail (Investigation Path)

**How Heroes Discover the Conspiracy:**

1. **Session 1:** Alchemical residue + journal fragment → "Dr. V" exists
2. **Session 2:** Witness testimony → "Dr. Venn working for Lord Morth"
3. **Session 3:** Receipt → Morth funded supernatural attack
4. **Session 5:** Monster programming → Venn has advanced capabilities
5. **Session 6:** Quorum mentioned repeatedly → It's an organization, not one person
6. **Session 7-8:** Venn's lab → Morth is Quorum leader; they have larger goal than just monster creation

**Each clue is independently discoverable** (redundancy prevents dead ends).  
**Failure to find one clue doesn't break investigation** (another contract provides similar info).

## Ending & Transition to Act II

**Final Scene (Session 8):**

After Venn escapes and heroes examine the evidence from his lab:

> Master Jorah spreads the documents across his desk. Financial records, commissioning orders, ritual diagrams. All bearing House Blackwood seals. All signed by Lord Treasurer Hadrian Morth.
>
> "This is bigger than monsters," Jorah says grimly. "This is treason. Conspiracy at the highest levels."
>
> He looks at each of you. "We can't storm the Blackwood Estate and arrest a Lord Treasurer. We need more evidence. We need allies. And we need to be very, very careful."
>
> A knock at the door. A young woman enters—well-dressed, intelligent eyes, radiating quiet authority.
>
> "Master Jorah," she says. "I'm Lady Mira Blackwood. I believe we have a mutual problem. My uncle, Lord Treasurer Morth, is plotting something terrible. And I need people I can trust to help me stop him."

**Hooks for Act II:**
- Investigate the Crimson Quorum (infiltrate, gather evidence)
- Ally with Lady Mira (navigate noble politics)
- Protect loyalist nobles (Quorum will escalate to assassination)
- Uncover Quorum's true goal (it's not just about monster creation)

## GM Guidance: Running Act I

**Pacing:**
- Sessions 1-3: Fast-paced; one contract per session
- Session 4: Breather; roleplay and research
- Sessions 5-6: Moderate pace; deeper investigations
- Sessions 7-8: Slow burn to climax; dungeon delve + revelation

**Investigation Tips:**
- Provide core clues liberally (what, where, who)
- Make extra clues reward good rolls (how, why, connections)
- Never dead-end; alternate clue paths exist
- Let players drive questions; answer honestly

**Combat Balance:**
- Early fights (1-3) should be Moderate (teach system)
- Mid-act fights (4-6) can be Moderate-Severe (challenge growing skill)
- Climax fight (7-8) should be Severe (epic showdown)
- Allow preparation to reduce difficulty

**Character Development:**
- Session 1-3: Heroes prove themselves (earn Jorah's trust)
- Session 4-6: Heroes become respected (full Order membership)
- Session 7-8: Heroes as investigators (solving conspiracy, not just fighting)

**Foreshadowing Act II:**
- Drop mentions of "the Quorum" early and often
- Show Morth in background (never center stage yet)
- NPC conversations hint at noble corruption
- Strange deaths of people who "knew too much"

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Don't let investigation become frustrating (provide clues)
- Don't make Morth easy to confront (he's politically protected)
- Don't let combat overshadow mystery (balance pillars)
- Don't ignore player theories (even wrong ones teach you their interests)

**Success Metrics:**
- Players feel like competent investigators
- Mystery is compelling (they want to know "why")
- NPCs are memorable and liked/hated appropriately
- Contracts feel varied despite similar structure
