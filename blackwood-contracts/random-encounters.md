## GM Notes: Using Random Encounters

**Purpose:**
- **Pacing:** Control how fast players move through regions
- **Atmosphere:** Reinforce setting (Thornhaven is tense, Blackwood is dangerous)
- **Resources:** Drain resources (HP, spells, consumables) before major encounters
- **Lore:** Provide clues and worldbuilding
- **Consequence:** Show campaign progress (more void-touched in Act III, etc.)

**When to Roll:**
- **Always:** When players are traveling through dangerous areas (Blackwood, Sanctum)
- **Sometimes:** In Thornhaven if players are investigating (shows tension)
- **Never:** When players are in safe locations (guildhall, allied NPC homes) or during critical plot scenes

**Adjusting Frequency:**
- **Speed Up:** Roll less often or skip rolls; narrate quick travel
- **Slow Down:** Roll more often or trigger encounters on wider range (3-11)
- **Create Tension:** Narrate near-misses ("You hear something in the distance, but it passes")

**Rewards:**
- **Combat Encounters:** Award XP as normal (but don't count toward milestones; those are story-based)
- **Social/Exploration:** Award story rewards (information, contacts, reputation)
- **Treasure:** Keep total campaign wealth on-track; random loot counts toward level budget

**Combining Results (2 or 12):**
- **Example:** Quorum Spy + Escaped Monster = Spy was tracking the monster; can ally temporarily or betray party
- **Example:** Druid Patrol + Corrupted Grove = Druids fighting corruption; can help or it's too late (druids are corrupted)

**Player Choice:**
- Always allow players to avoid combat via stealth, negotiation, or clever thinking
- Random encounters shouldn't feel forced; they're consequences of environment and decisions

**Scaling:**
- Adjust encounter levels based on party level (most tables assume party at expected level for act)
- For 3 PCs: Reduce enemy count or downgrade severity
- For 5+ PCs: Add enemies or upgrade to elite/tough variants
