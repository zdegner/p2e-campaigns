# Session 02 — The Whispering Sickness

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Party Level:** 1-2  
**Location:** Thornhaven → Millford Village

## Goals

- **Story:** Investigate disease outbreak; discover it's artificially created by Dr. Venn
- **Mechanical:** XP toward Level 2; introduce disease/affliction mechanics
- **Mystery:** Connect this contract to Contract 1 (same alchemical signature)

## Opening Frame (10-15 min)

**Read Aloud:**

> Three days after the Rivermeet massacre, you're summoned to Master Jorah's office. The dwarf looks even more haggard than usual.
>
> "New contract, and it's bad," he says without preamble. "Village of Millford—farming community, two days west. They sent a rider yesterday. Says half the village is sick with something that makes them violent. Attacking neighbors, biting, clawing. Then they die... and get back up."
>
> He slides a crumpled letter across the desk. The handwriting is shaky, panicked.
>
> "The rider didn't make it. Horse came back alone, covered in blood. We found him on the road this morning—throat torn out. Whatever's in Millford, it's spreading fast."

**Choices:**

- **A. Depart immediately:** Jorah provides horses and supplies; warns to avoid infection
- **B. Research first:** Spend 2 hours in library (see Research section below)
- **C. Requisition protective gear:** Jorah provides alchemical face masks (grants +1 to saves vs. inhaled disease)

**Scene Goals:**
- Establish urgency (village is dying)
- Foreshadow undead (they "get back up")
- Allow heroes to prepare

---

## Scene 1: Research (Optional, 20-30 min)

**If heroes research before departing:**

### Library Research

**Religion DC 15:** The "Whispering Sickness" was a plague centuries ago, associated with ghoul cults. Victims became violent, developed cannibalistic urges, then died and rose as ghouls.

**Medicine DC 17:** Whispering Sickness is transmitted through bites and bodily fluids. Incubation period is 12-24 hours. No known natural cure, but positive energy (healing magic) slows progression.

**Occultism DC 19:** The historical Whispering Sickness was necromantic in origin—someone created it deliberately. It required rare alchemical components and necromantic rituals to brew.

### Old Meg Consultation

If heroes visit Old Meg again:

> "Whispering Sickness?" She cackles, not unkindly. "Haven't heard that name in fifty years. Nasty business. Ghoul plague. Someone has to brew it—doesn't occur naturally. You're looking for an alchemist, dearie. One with access to corpses and no conscience."

She provides:
- Formula for "Plague Ward" tincture (grants +2 to saves vs. disease; costs 5 gp per dose; takes 2 hours to brew)
- Warning: "Don't let them bite you."

---

## Scene 2: The Road to Millford (15 min)

**Read Aloud:**

> The journey west takes you through farmland that grows increasingly neglected. Fields lie untended. Farmhouses stand silent, doors ajar. No smoke rises from chimneys. Once, you spot a figure in the distance, stumbling across a field—but it doesn't respond to your calls.
>
> Late on the second day, you crest a hill and see Millford in the valley below. Smoke rises from several buildings—not cook fires, but something burning out of control. The village is silent. Too silent.

**Environment:**
- Abandoned farms; livestock dead or fled
- Atmosphere of dread
- No living people visible on approach

**Checks:**

- **Perception DC 15:** Notice movement in village—shuffling figures, unnatural gait
- **Medicine DC 17:** Smell of rot and disease on the wind
- **Survival DC 15:** Tracks show villagers fleeing in all directions; some dragged back toward center

**Encounter (Optional):**

As heroes approach, a ghoul shambles out of a barn.

**Creature:** 1× Ghoul (Bestiary p. 186)  
**XP:** 30 XP (Low threat for level 2 party)

**Tactics:**
- Ghoul is mindless, attacks nearest living creature
- Uses bite/claw; attempts to paralyze

**Skill Alternative:**
- **Stealth DC 15 (group check):** Avoid ghoul entirely
- **Religion DC 17:** Recall that ghouls hate sunlight (if daytime, lure it into open for disadvantage)

**Loot:**
- Torn clothing with Millford embroidery
- Journal fragment in pocket: "Water tastes funny. Marcus says he feels strange." (first clue: disease is waterborne)

---

## Scene 3: Millford Village Investigation (45-60 min)

**Read Aloud:**

> Millford is a nightmare. Bodies—or what used to be bodies—shuffle through the streets. Ghouls. At least a dozen. They wear the tattered remains of farming clothes. Some were children.
>
> In the center of town, the well stands. Its water looks greenish and fouls the air around it.
>
> At the edge of the village, barricaded inside the church, you see signs of life: smoke from a chimney, a makeshift barrier at the door. Someone survived.

**Environment:**
- **Terrain:** Village streets; buildings provide cover
- **Hazards:** Ghouls patrol randomly; smoke from fires creates obscured zones
- **Objective:** Investigate well, reach church survivors, cleanse infection source

### Investigation Points

**The Contaminated Well (Core Clue):**

If heroes examine the well:

**Read Aloud:**

> The well water is a sickly green color. An oily film floats on the surface. At the bottom, you can barely make out shattered glass vials—dozens of them.

**Checks:**

- **Crafting (Alchemy) DC 15:** The residue matches the Rivermeet alchemical signature—same creator
- **Medicine DC 17:** This is concentrated Whispering Sickness pathogen, deliberately introduced
- **Survival DC 15:** The vials were dropped in approximately 5 days ago (timeline matches onset)

**Clue:** Someone deliberately poisoned Millford's water supply. This wasn't an accident.

**The Church Survivors:**

Approach requires dealing with ghouls or sneaking past.

**Stealth DC 18 (group check):** Sneak to church unnoticed  
**Intimidation/Performance DC 17:** Draw ghouls away with noise/distraction

Inside the church: 6 survivors, led by Father Dorian (elderly priest of Sarenrae). They're terrified, low on food/water, and grateful for rescue.

**Diplomacy DC 13:** Father Dorian explains:
- Sickness started 5 days ago after village fair (everyone drank from well)
- Victims became violent within hours, attacked others
- Those bitten also fell sick
- Dead rose as ghouls
- Survivors barricaded themselves here; running out of supplies

**Important Testimony:** Father Dorian saw a "cloaked figure" near the well on the night before the outbreak. The figure dropped something into the water and fled when spotted.

**Perception DC 19 or Investigation DC 17:** Found in church cellar—villager's journal. Last entry: "Saw Dr. Venn at the well last night. Thought he was inspecting it for Lord Morth. But why at midnight?"

**Major Clue:** This confirms "Dr. Venn" is the creator AND connects him to "Lord Morth" (who will be revealed as Crimson Quorum leader in Act II).

---

## Scene 4: Cleansing the Well (30-45 min)

**Heroes must decide how to purify the well and deal with ghouls.**

### Options:

**A. Direct Combat**
- Fight all ghouls (12 total)
- Very dangerous at level 1-2
- Can reduce numbers by kiting or using terrain

**B. Ritual Purification (Recommended)**
- Father Dorian knows a ritual to cleanse the well (requires positive energy)
- Must protect him while he performs 10-minute ritual
- Ghouls will attack; heroes hold them off

**C. Destroy the Well**
- Collapse well with explosives or engineering
- Prevents further infection
- But villagers need a new water source (requires future aid)

### Encounter: Defend the Ritual

If heroes choose option B (most likely):

**Setup:**
- Father Dorian begins ritual at well
- Ghouls converge after 2 rounds (sound attracts them)
- Heroes must hold them off for 10 rounds

**Creatures:**
- Waves of ghouls: 2 arrive every 2 rounds (total: 10 ghouls over 10 rounds)
- **Scaling:** For 3 PCs, reduce to 1 per wave; for 5 PCs, increase to 3 per wave

**XP Budget:**
- 10× Ghouls = 300 XP (Severe encounter if fought all at once)
- **Wave Combat:** Lower effective difficulty (Moderate overall)

**Tactics:**
- Ghouls are mindless; attack nearest living creature
- Use bite to paralyze, then claw while target is helpless
- No morale; fight until destroyed

**Skill Alternatives:**
- **Crafting DC 17:** Create barricades/traps; reduce ghouls per wave by 1
- **Religion DC 15:** Help Father Dorian (speeds ritual, completes in 8 rounds instead of 10)
- **Athletics DC 18:** Collapse building onto ghoul group (eliminates 1 wave)

**Victory:**
- Ritual completes; well cleansed
- Ghouls collapse and dissolve (necromantic energy severed)
- Village is safe; survivors can rebuild

**Consequences:**

### Victory
- Contract payment: 30 gp per PC + gratitude of Millford survivors
- Father Dorian provides blessing (heroes gain +1 status bonus to saves vs. disease for 1 week)
- Guild Reputation +1 (now 6/8 or 4/8)
- Major clue: Dr. Venn and Lord Morth are connected

### Partial (Ritual Interrupted)
- Well partially cleansed; some ghouls remain
- Must return to finish job
- Payment reduced: 15 gp per PC

### Failure
- Ritual fails; ghouls overrun church
- Father Dorian dies heroically buying heroes time to escape
- Village is lost; survivors flee
- Guild Reputation -1
- Heroes must report failure to Jorah (uncomfortable scene)

---

## Outcomes & Prep for Next Time

### State Changes
- **Guild Reputation Clock:** +1 (success) or -1 (failure)
- **Crimson Quorum Clock (The Awakening):** +1 (another creation deployed) — now at 2/8
- **Pattern Established:** Heroes recognize alchemical signature from both contracts

### Loot Granted
- **Contract Payment:** 30 gp per PC
- **Father Dorian's Blessing:** +1 status bonus to saves vs. disease (1 week)
- **Alchemical Samples:** Can collect pathogen samples from well (requires alchemy tools; valuable for research)

### Open Hooks
- **Dr. Venn's Identity:** Who is this alchemist creating monsters and plagues?
- **Lord Morth Connection:** Father Dorian saw Venn "working for" Morth—noble corruption?
- **Pattern of Attacks:** Two major incidents in one week—more coming?
- **Quorum Reference:** Journal fragment from Session 1 mentioned "Quorum"—is Morth part of it?

### GM Prep Checklist for Next Session
- [ ] Prepare Contract 3 (The Phantom Bride—ghost at Iron Bridge)
- [ ] Create encounter for bound specter
- [ ] Stat out necromantic trap/binding
- [ ] Update NPC list: Add Father Dorian (grateful ally)
- [ ] Foreshadow: Heroes may investigate Lord Morth (noble they can't easily confront yet)

## Table Tools

### Safety
- **Veils:** Ghouls described as "shambling corpses," not graphic decay; focus on tactics, not horror
- **Check-In:** Before describing child ghouls, ask "Is everyone okay with undead children as enemies?"

### Pace Knobs
- **Speed-Up:** Skip travel; start in Millford. Or: Provide well clue immediately
- **Slow-Down:** Add survivor NPC interaction (child looking for parents, ethical dilemma about infected-but-not-turned villager)

### Emergency Cliffhangers
- **Option 1:** End on ritual start; ghouls hear and begin approaching (initiative next session)
- **Option 2:** Well cleansed, but cloaked figure (Venn?) watches from forest (spotted on Perception DC 20)
- **Option 3:** As heroes leave, messenger arrives from Thornhaven—another attack reported

---

## Milestone: Level Up to 2

**If heroes completed Contracts 1-2 successfully, they advance to Level 2.**

**Narrate:**

> Back at the Silverchain Guildhall, Master Jorah reviews your reports. The chimeric wolves. The weaponized plague. The same alchemical signature at both sites.
>
> "We have a pattern," he says grimly. "Someone is creating these things deliberately. And they're escalating."
>
> He looks at each of you with his one good eye. "You've proven yourselves. You're no longer initiates—you're full members of the Order."
>
> He produces silver badges—the Chain symbol of the guild. "Wear these with pride. And get ready. This isn't over."

**Mechanical:**
- Heroes gain Level 2
- Awarded Order membership (mechanical benefit: +1 circumstance bonus to Gather Information about monsters in Thornhaven)
- Access to restricted library section (higher-level bestiaries)

---

**Next Session Preview:**

> Reports come in of a specter haunting the Iron Bridge—a vital trade route. Travelers are lured to their deaths by a ghostly bride in a wedding dress. But investigation reveals something sinister: this isn't a natural haunting. Someone bound this spirit here deliberately. The question is: why?

**End of Session 02**
