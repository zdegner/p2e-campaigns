# Session 01 — Blood on the Roses

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Party Level:** 1  
**Location:** Thornhaven → Rivermeet Manor

## Goals

- **Story:** Introduce the heroes, establish the Order of the Silver Chain, and complete their first contract—investigate the Rivermeet massacre
- **Mechanical:** Milestone toward Level 2; teach investigation→research→prepare→hunt cycle
- **Tone:** Establish dark-heroic atmosphere; competent professionals investigating horror

## Opening Frame (15-20 min)

**Read Aloud:**

> The city of Thornhaven wakes to another gray morning. Fog rolls off the Blackwood River, shrouding the cobblestone streets in damp mist. You're seated in the common room of the Silverchain Guildhall—a sturdy stone building that smells of leather, oil, and old parchment. Around you, fellow monster hunters prepare for their day: sharpening blades, mixing alchemical preparations, studying bestiaries.
>
> Master Jorah Silverchain—a grizzled dwarf with an eyepatch and more scars than most people have wrinkles—approaches your table. He carries a sealed envelope bearing a blood-red wax seal.
>
> "Contract came in overnight," he says, his voice gravelly from decades of shouting orders. "Constable from Rivermeet rode through the night to deliver it. Wedding party—two dozen guests—slaughtered. Witnesses say something unnatural did it. Something with too many heads."
>
> He drops the envelope on the table.
>
> "You lot are the ones available. Rivermeet's four hours upriver. Bodies are still warm. I need you to investigate, identify what did this, and stop it before it kills again." His one good eye studies each of you in turn. "Questions?"

**Choices:**

- **A. Accept immediately:** Jorah nods approvingly. "Good. Take what you need from the armory. Leave within the hour."
- **B. Ask for more details:** Jorah provides the contract letter (handout: describes massacre, mentions "wolves but wrong," no survivors coherent enough to interview yet)
- **C. Request additional resources:** Jorah allows heroes to requisition basic supplies (50 gp budget), alchemical items, or borrow a library book on canine monsters

**Scene Goals:**
- Establish Master Jorah as mentor figure
- Set up investigation structure (you're professionals hired to solve a problem)
- Get party motivated and en route

**Key NPCs:**
- Master Jorah Silverchain (see NPC folder)

## Scene 1: The Journey to Rivermeet (30 min)

**Read Aloud:**

> The river road winds northeast through farmland and scattered woodland. As you travel, the fog thickens. Crows watch from fence posts. Farmers pause in their work to stare as you pass—word has spread that the Order is on the move.
>
> After three hours, you smell it: smoke and blood on the wind.

**Environment & Stakes:**
- 4-hour journey (opportunity for character introductions, party bonding)
- Atmosphere builds tension: fog, crows, uneasy locals
- Arrive in late morning; crime scene is fresh

**Skill Challenges (Optional):**

- **Nature DC 15 (Trained):** Notice unusual tracks in the mud near the road—wolf prints, but larger than normal, and the gait is wrong (walks upright sometimes?)
- **Society DC 15:** Recall that Rivermeet Manor belongs to the Ashford family, minor nobility with ties to House Blackwood
- **Perception DC 17:** Spot claw marks on trees along the road—something marked territory here recently

**Roleplay Opportunities:**
- Party members share why they joined the Order (character hooks)
- Discuss approach: investigate first or secure the scene?
- NPC encounter: Pass a farmer fleeing Rivermeet with his family; if asked, he says "demons" attacked

**Pacing Note:** Don't roll for every check; let players describe how they travel and interact. This scene is about establishing party dynamics and building tension.

## Scene 2: The Crime Scene (45-60 min)

**Read Aloud:**

> Rivermeet Manor sprawls across a low hill overlooking the river. It's a beautiful estate—or was. White stone walls, rose gardens, a fountain courtyard. But now the roses are trampled, the fountain runs red, and bodies lie scattered across the lawn like broken dolls.
>
> A dozen local watchmen stand guard, looking pale and shaken. A priest of Pharasma moves among the dead, speaking prayers. The constable—a middle-aged human woman with haunted eyes—approaches you.
>
> "Order of the Silver Chain?" she asks. When you confirm, she exhales in relief. "Thank the gods. I'm Constable Maren. Twenty-three dead. Four survivors—two are catatonic, one keeps screaming about 'wolves with human eyes,' and one just rocks back and forth. The... the thing or things responsible fled into the woods about two hours before dawn. We haven't dared follow."

**Environment Investigation:**

This is the heart of the session—teach the investigation loop. Provide clues liberally. Heroes should feel competent.

### Core Clues (Always Found)

1. **Track Marks:** Clear paw prints leading to/from the forest. Wolf-sized, but the stride pattern is wrong—sometimes four-legged, sometimes bipedal. (Nature DC 13 or just careful observation)

2. **Alchemical Residue:** Strange chemical smell near several bodies. A greenish residue on claws/bite wounds that doesn't match natural wolf saliva. (Medicine DC 15 or Crafting DC 15)

3. **Surgical Scars:** If heroes examine the tracks closely or find wolf fur, they notice the creatures shed fur that has faint scars—surgical marks, like these creatures were... altered. (Medicine DC 17 or Nature DC 17)

4. **Journal Fragment:** Found clutched in victim's hand—torn page from someone's journal. Text reads: "Dr. V assures me the modifications will make them perfect hunters. Intelligence, pack coordination, but retained lethality. The Quorum will be pleased." (Perception DC 15 to find, Society DC 17 to recognize "Quorum" might be an organization)

### Extra Clues (Reward Good Checks)

5. **Witness Interview:** The survivor who can speak (a terrified young man named Tomas) describes: "They moved like soldiers. Flanking. Cutting off escapes. And their eyes... they watched us like they were enjoying it." (Diplomacy DC 15 to get him to open up)

6. **Attack Pattern:** If heroes map out the bodies, the attack was strategically planned—exits were blocked first, then creatures herded victims into the courtyard kill zone. This wasn't mindless slaughter. (Perception DC 19 or Warfare Lore DC 15)

7. **Chemical Analysis:** If heroes have alchemical knowledge, the residue contains compounds used in transmutation alchemy—specifically, formulae for enhancing physical traits. (Crafting (alchemy) DC 17)

**Fail-Forward:** Even if heroes roll poorly, Constable Maren provides basic info ("tracks lead northwest"), priest mentions "unnatural wounds," and the journal fragment is found by a watchman who hands it over.

**Checks:**

- **Medicine DC 15:** Identify cause of death (mostly trauma—bites, claws); notice alchemical residue
- **Nature DC 15:** Tracks are wolf-like but modified; creatures are partially bipedal
- **Perception DC 15:** Find journal fragment
- **Diplomacy DC 15:** Get coherent testimony from Tomas
- **Arcana/Occultism DC 17:** Alchemical residue suggests artificial enhancement, not natural magic
- **Society DC 17:** "The Quorum" isn't a known organization, but the phrasing suggests noble patronage

**NPC Interaction:**
- Constable Maren: Overwhelmed, grateful for help, can provide horses or supplies
- Priest of Pharasma: Solemn, mentions he'll prepare bodies for burial; notes wounds are "unclean"
- Tomas (survivor): Traumatized but can describe attack if treated gently

---

## Scene 3: Return to Thornhaven (Optional, 15-20 min)

**Depending on time, heroes may return to research or go straight to tracking.**

**If heroes return to Silverchain Guildhall:**

- Access to library: Research wolves, alchemy, or "the Quorum"
- **Nature/Arcana DC 15:** Find references to chimeric creatures—magically fused animals
- **Society DC 19:** No record of "Crimson Quorum" in guild archives (it's secret)
- **Crafting DC 17:** Formulae for enhancement alchemy exists theoretically, but creating living creatures is cutting-edge and rare

**If heroes consult Old Meg (requires knowing about her or asking Jorah):**

Old Meg lives in a hut 3 miles north of Thornhaven. She's eccentric but knowledgeable.

**Read Aloud:**

> The hut reeks of preserved specimens and incense. Old Meg—a wizened woman of indeterminate age—examines the residue you've brought. She hums to herself, occasionally muttering to her cat.
>
> "Chimeric work," she finally says. "Someone's been stitching wolf parts together—maybe blending multiple wolves, maybe adding other bits. Alchemy to force the fusion. Nasty work. Illegal in most places." She taps the journal fragment. "Your 'Dr. V' is either brilliant or mad. Possibly both."

- Meg can provide info on chimeric weaknesses: Fire is effective; coordinated attacks confuse them
- She offers to sell heroes alchemist's fire (2 flasks at 3 gp each)

**Preparation Montage:**

If heroes prep before tracking:
- Craft/buy alchemist's fire or other tools
- Prepare spells (if casters)
- Plan tactics ("we focus fire on one at a time")

**Reward Preparation:** Note what heroes prepare; grant +1 circumstance bonus to relevant checks during the hunt.

## Scene 4: The Hunt (60-75 min)

**Read Aloud:**

> The tracks lead northwest into the forest. The undergrowth is torn up—these creatures weren't subtle. After an hour of tracking, you smell wet fur and rotting meat. The trail leads to a collapsed barn, half-buried in vines and moss.
>
> From inside, you hear low growls and the sound of gnawing.

**Environment:**
- **Terrain:** Collapsed barn interior; difficult terrain (rubble, rotting wood); partial cover from walls
- **Lighting:** Dim (overcast day + forest canopy)
- **Hazards:** Rotting floorboards (Reflex DC 15 or fall prone)
- **Tactics:** Wolves are feeding on stolen livestock; they'll attack if disturbed

**Encounter: Chimeric Wolf Pack**

**Creatures:**
- 3× Chimeric Wolves (use Wolf stats from Bestiary p. 334, but add the following modifications)
  - **Modified:** Each wolf has two heads (giving it scent, keen 30 feet)
  - **Intelligence:** They use pack tactics; will attempt to flank and trip
  - **Alchemical Enhancement:** If reduced to 0 HP, make DC 15 Fortitude save; on success, remains at 1 HP and becomes enraged (+2 damage, -1 AC) until next turn

**XP Budget:**
- Party of 4 level-1 PCs: Moderate encounter = 80 XP
- 3× Wolves = 30 XP each = 90 XP total (Moderate-High)

**Scaling:**
- **For 3 PCs:** Remove 1 wolf
- **For 5 PCs:** Add 1 wolf or upgrade one to "alpha" (elite template: +2 AC, +2 attacks, +4 HP)

**Tactics:**
- Wolves use pack tactics: flank, Trip when possible
- If alpha is included, it directs others (uses Aid action to boost pack's attacks)
- Retreat if 2+ wolves drop; flee into deep forest

**Skill Alternatives (Avoid/Mitigate Combat):**

- **Survival DC 17:** Set snare/trap at barn entrance before wolves notice; trap triggers on first wolf for automatic damage
- **Nature DC 19:** Recognize wolf feeding pattern; circle around and ambush from behind
- **Stealth DC 18 (group check):** Sneak close enough to hit with ranged attacks before initiative
- **Intimidation DC 20:** Scare wolves into retreating (requires visible threat—fire, loud noise, magical display)

**Consequences:**

### Victory
- Wolves defeated or driven off
- Heroes can examine wolf corpses: confirm surgical scars, alchemical enhancement organs
- Find lair contains remains of livestock + piece of torn fabric with embroidered seal (minor noble house; requires Society DC 17 to identify—leads to future contract)
- Constable Maren pays contract fee: 20 gp per PC + 50 gp bonus (for quick resolution)
- Master Jorah is impressed; heroes gain +1 to Guild Reputation clock

### Partial (Wolves Escape)
- Heroes damage pack; wolves flee
- Contract incomplete—wolves will attack again in 1d4 days
- Payment reduced: 10 gp per PC
- Must track them again (longer investigation)

### Retreat/Failure
- Heroes forced to withdraw
- Wolves claim the forest; another attack within 24 hours (different target)
- Guild Reputation -1
- Heroes must return better prepared

## Outcomes & Prep for Next Time

### State Changes
- **Guild Reputation Clock:** +1 (success) or -1 (failure) — now at 5/8 or 3/8
- **Crimson Quorum Clock (The Awakening):** +1 (wolves were one of their creations active) — now at 1/8

### Loot Granted
- **Contract Payment:** 20 gp per PC + 50 gp party bonus (if successful)
- **Wolf Parts:** Can harvest alchemical organs (sell for 5 gp each) or keep for crafting
- **Torn Fabric:** Clue for future contract (embroidered noble seal)

### Open Hooks
- **Who is "Dr. V"?** The journal fragment references a mysterious alchemist
- **What is "the Quorum"?** Unknown organization sponsoring monster creation
- **The Embroidered Seal:** Leads to another noble family (potential next contract)
- **More Monsters?** If this was one creation, are there others?

### GM Prep Checklist for Next Session
- [ ] Review heroes' investigation approach; note what worked
- [ ] Prepare Contract 2 (The Whispering Sickness—village outbreak)
- [ ] Stat out intelligent ghouls encounter
- [ ] Update NPC attitudes (Jorah impressed, Constable Maren grateful)
- [ ] If heroes researched "Quorum," prepare red herring info (false leads to keep mystery alive)

## Table Tools

### Safety
- **Veils:** Describe massacre aftermath (bodies) clinically, not graphically; focus on clues, not gore
- **Check-In:** Before describing crime scene, ask "Everyone okay with investigating a mass murder site?"

### Pace Knobs
- **Speed-Up:** Skip travel scene; start at crime scene. Or: Provide core clues automatically if investigation drags
- **Slow-Down:** Add NPC interaction (priest of Pharasma shares folklore about unnatural creatures), or include roleplay with Tomas

### Emergency Cliffhangers (if short on time)
- **Option 1:** End on initiative roll as wolves attack ("Roll initiative!" → end session)
- **Option 2:** Heroes track wolves to lair but hear more growls than expected—reinforcements incoming? (end on tension)
- **Option 3:** As heroes examine wolf corpses, a cloaked figure watches from the forest (mysterious observer—is it Dr. V?) then flees

---

## Post-Session Debrief

**Ask Players:**
- "How did you feel about the investigation? Too easy/hard?"
- "Did you enjoy the monster hunting cycle (investigate→prepare→hunt)?"
- "Are there NPCs you want to interact with more?"
- "What threads are you most interested in pursuing?"

**GM Notes:**
- Track which clues players emphasized (shows what mysteries interest them)
- Note player creativity (did they come up with solutions you didn't expect?)
- Adjust difficulty if combat was too easy/hard
- Confirm safety tools worked (no one uncomfortable with content)

**Next Session Preview:**

> Word reaches the Order: The village of Millford, two days west, has been struck by a mysterious illness. Victims become violent, attacking neighbors before dying. But the dead don't stay dead. Constable requests immediate aid—this could be an outbreak of the Whispering Sickness, a plague thought extinct for a century.
