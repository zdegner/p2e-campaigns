# Session 03 — The Phantom Bride

**Estimated Time:** 3 hours  
**Party Level:** 2  
**Location:** Thornhaven → Iron Bridge

## Goals

- **Story:** Investigate bound ghost; discover Quorum uses supernatural threats as distractions
- **Mechanical:** Practice occult investigation; introduce non-combat resolution options
- **Mystery:** Clues point to Crimson Quorum's black market operations

## Opening Frame (10 min)

**Read Aloud:**

> The Iron Bridge spans the Blackwood River at its widest point, connecting Thornhaven to the northern trade roads. For two weeks now, travelers have reported a ghostly woman in a bloodstained wedding dress, appearing at midnight to lure people off the bridge. Three are dead—drowned in the river below.
>
> Master Jorah lays out maps and witness statements. "The Watch thinks it's a standard haunting—jilted bride, tragic death, seeking revenge. But I'm not convinced. Ghosts don't appear on schedule. And this one seems... deliberate. Like someone placed it there."
>
> He taps the map. "The bridge is also our primary trade route. Merchants are refusing to cross after dark. The economy is starting to hurt. Figure out what's really happening and end it."

**Choices:**

- **A. Interview witnesses first:** Visit survivors and grieving families
- **B. Research hauntings:** Spend time in library learning about bound spirits
- **C. Stake out the bridge:** Go directly to location and wait for midnight

**Scene Goals:**
- Establish that this feels off (ghosts don't work this way)
- Introduce idea of artificial/weaponized supernatural threats

---

## Scene 1: Investigation Phase (30-45 min)

### Witness Interviews

**Three survivors (if heroes seek them out):**

**Survivor 1 — Marcus Trent (merchant):**
> "She appeared right at midnight—exactly midnight, I checked my pocket watch. Beautiful, but wrong. Her eyes were empty. She sang this... lullaby? Called me to come closer. I nearly stepped off before my partner grabbed me."

**Clue:** Appears at exact time (unnatural precision for emotional haunting)

**Survivor 2 — Elara Moss (traveler):**
> "I saw her two nights ago. She was crying, saying her groom abandoned her. But... I'm trained in performance. She wasn't crying right. Like an actor who forgot their motivation. Just going through motions."

**Clue:** Spirit seems scripted, not genuinely emotional

**Survivor 3 — Old Willem (beggar who sleeps near bridge):**
> "I see her every night now. But here's the thing, friend—she doesn't attack everyone. Rich merchants? She goes after them. Poor folk like me? She ignores us completely. What kind of ghost is that selective?"

**Major Clue:** Ghost targets wealthy merchants specifically (economic disruption)

### Research (Library or Old Meg)

**Occultism DC 15:** Standard ghosts are tied to trauma and manifest unpredictably. Bound spirits—those magically compelled—can be controlled with specific parameters (time, targets, behavior).

**Religion DC 17:** Creating a bound spirit requires: the ghost's remains, a necromantic anchor (ritual focus), and knowledge of the spirit's death. Breaking the binding requires destroying the anchor.

**Society DC 19:** Iron Bridge is critical infrastructure. If trade stops, Thornhaven's economy suffers. Several noble houses would benefit from economic disruption—including those with alternative trade routes.

**Old Meg (if consulted):**
> "Bound spirit, dearie. Someone's using that poor girl as a weapon. Find what's anchoring her—usually something from her life or death. Destroy it, she's free. But be careful—whoever bound her won't like you meddling."

---

## Scene 2: The Bridge at Midnight (45-60 min)

**Read Aloud:**

> The Iron Bridge looms over the dark water. The river rushes below, swift and cold. Fog rises from the surface, shrouding the bridge's center. The church bells of Thornhaven chime midnight.
>
> And she appears.
>
> A young woman in a bloodstained wedding dress materializes at the bridge's center. Her face is beautiful but expressionless. She opens her mouth and begins to sing—a haunting lullaby that tugs at your heart.

**Environment:**
- **Terrain:** Bridge (narrow, 15 feet wide); railings on both sides (DC 15 Athletics to climb over)
- **Hazards:** 40-foot drop to river (4d6 falling damage + drowning risk)
- **Weather:** Fog (concealment); light rain (slippery, -1 circumstance penalty to Acrobatics)

### Encounter: The Phantom Bride

**Creature:** Bound Specter (use Ghost stats, Bestiary p. 184, with modifications)
- **Modifications:** Cannot move more than 60 feet from anchor point; if anchor is found, ghost loses rejuvenation ability
- **Behavior:** Scripted—lures targets toward railing, then pushes with telekinesis

**XP:** 60 XP (Moderate encounter for 4 level-2 PCs)

**Tactics:**
1. **Round 1:** Sings lullaby (Will DC 17 save or become fascinated, compelled to move toward her)
2. **Subsequent Rounds:** Uses Telekinetic Maneuver to push fascinated targets off bridge
3. If attacked, shifts to defensive (incorporeal, resistant to physical damage)
4. Cannot pursue beyond 60 feet from anchor

### Non-Combat Resolution (Recommended Path)

**During Encounter:**

**Perception DC 18:** Notice the ghost keeps glancing at a specific spot under the bridge—a support column with faint necromantic glow

**Occultism DC 17:** Recognize binding ritual signature; anchor must be nearby

**Diplomacy DC 19:** Speak to ghost ("What happened to you? Who bound you?"); she responds mechanically: "Free... me... please..."

**Finding the Anchor:**

The anchor is under the bridge, attached to a support column (requires climbing down or using magic/rope).

**Read Aloud:**

> Fastened to the stone column is a small wooden box, carved with necromantic runes. Inside: a bloodstained wedding ring, a lock of hair, and a journal page describing the bride's death (she was murdered by bandits on her wedding night 30 years ago). The page is signed "Prepared for the Quorum by V."

**Destroying the Anchor:**

- **Force/Damage:** Smash the box (Hardness 5, 15 HP)
- **Dispel Magic:** Counteract check (DC 19)
- **Religion:** Purify with positive energy (DC 17)

**When Anchor is Destroyed:**

**Read Aloud:**

> The runes flare brilliant white and shatter. The ghost stumbles, her empty expression cracking. For the first time, she looks aware—alive, even. She mouths "thank you" before dissipating into golden light. The oppressive cold lifts.
>
> On the ground where the box fell, you find a receipt: "Payment received for binding ritual. -V. Delivered per Lord Treasurer Morth's specifications."

**Major Clue:** Lord Morth (noble mentioned in Session 2) commissioned this supernatural attack. Venn is working for him.

---

## Scene 3: Aftermath & Investigation (20-30 min)

### Following the Clue

The receipt provides an address: A shop in Thornhaven's Wailing Market (black market district).

**If heroes investigate the shop:**

It's an occult supply store run by a nervous halfling named Pip.

**Intimidation DC 15 or Diplomacy DC 17:**
> "Look, I just sold him the components, okay? Graveyard dirt, binding chalk, ritual candles. He paid well, didn't ask questions. But yeah, he mentioned working for someone important. Said it was for 'disrupting trade routes.' Paid in gold stamped with House Blackwood's seal."

**Clue:** House Blackwood's treasury funded this. Morth has access to noble resources.

**Society DC 19:** Lord Treasurer Hadrian Morth manages House Blackwood's finances. He's respected, trusted by the current Lord Blackwood. Accusing him without concrete proof would be political suicide.

**If heroes try to confront Morth directly:**

He's untouchable at this stage. Constable Kael (if asked) says:
> "Morth is Lord Blackwood's right hand. You'd need ironclad evidence to even get a warrant. And he has powerful friends. Be very careful."

**Scene Goal:** Establish that the conspiracy reaches into the nobility, and heroes can't just kick down doors—they need to be clever and gather more evidence.

## Outcomes & Prep for Next Time

### State Changes
- **Guild Reputation Clock:** +1 (saved trade route) — now at 7/8 or 5/8
- **Crimson Quorum Clock (The Awakening):** No change (this was a side operation, not monster creation)
- **Political Tension:** Heroes are now on Quorum's radar (if they traced clues to Morth's involvement)

### Loot Granted
- **Contract Payment:** 40 gp per PC
- **Occult Components:** Leftover ritual materials from anchor (worth 20 gp, or useful for crafting)
- **Receipt/Evidence:** Physical proof of Morth's involvement (critical for later)

### Open Hooks
- **Lord Treasurer Morth:** Connected to Venn, funded ghost binding, has political power
- **The Crimson Quorum:** Still mysterious; Morth is clearly a member, but who else?
- **House Blackwood:** Is the entire noble house corrupt, or just Morth?
- **More Attacks Coming:** If Morth knows heroes are investigating, he may act

### GM Prep Checklist for Next Session
- [ ] Prepare Session 4 (Interlude: Meeting the Order formally; research montage)
- [ ] Introduce Lady Mira Blackwood (reformist noble, potential ally against Morth)
- [ ] Foreshadow Contract 4 (Blood Moon Beast—phase spider targeting specific noble bloodline)
- [ ] Update NPC attitudes: Morth becomes aware of heroes (hostile); Jorah impressed (mentor)

## Table Tools

### Safety
- **Veils:** Ghost's death (murdered on wedding night) mentioned but not described graphically
- **Check-In:** If players seem uncomfortable with tragic ghost story, allow them to focus on mechanical puzzle (finding anchor) over emotional narrative

### Pace Knobs
- **Speed-Up:** Provide anchor location automatically if investigation drags; focus on decision (destroy or study it?)
- **Slow-Down:** Add subplot—one PC is fascinated by ghost's song, must be rescued by party (builds tension)

### Emergency Cliffhangers
- **Option 1:** Heroes destroy anchor, but Quorum agent watching from shadows (spotted on Perception DC 22); he flees, they give chase (end on pursuit)
- **Option 2:** As heroes leave bridge, Constable Kael arrives with urgent news—another attack reported (Contract 4 hook)
- **Option 3:** Heroes followed from black market shop; ambushed by Quorum thugs (initiative roll, end session)

---

## Design Notes: Non-Lethal Resolution

This session is designed to teach players that **investigation and problem-solving can replace combat**. If heroes:
- Find the anchor quickly (good Perception/Occultism checks)
- Destroy it before engaging ghost
- Ghost dissolves peacefully

They avoid combat entirely. Reward this with:
- **Bonus XP:** Same XP as if they fought
- **Story Reward:** Ghost's grateful spirit provides vision/clue about Venn's lab location (advantage for Contract 4 or 6)
- **Roleplaying Satisfaction:** Players feel clever

**GM Principle:** Never punish players for avoiding combat through smart play. Award same XP, provide narrative benefits.

---

**Next Session Preview:**

> You're formally inducted into the Order of the Silver Chain. Master Jorah provides access to restricted resources and assigns you to investigate increasing monster activity. Meanwhile, a noblewoman named Lady Mira Blackwood requests a private meeting—she suspects corruption within her own house and needs discreet investigators she can trust.

**End of Session 03**
