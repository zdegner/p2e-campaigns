# Session Diary — Session 01

**Date:** [Insert IRL date]  
**In-Game Date:** Rainsday, 3rd of Calistril (early spring)  
**Party Level:** 1  
**Location:** Thornhaven → Rivermeet Manor

## What Happened (2-3 sentences)

[Example:]
The heroes met Master Jorah at the Silverchain Guildhall and accepted their first contract—investigating the Rivermeet Manor massacre. After traveling upriver and examining the crime scene, they discovered evidence of chimeric wolves created through alchemy. They tracked the creatures to a collapsed barn and defeated them, recovering evidence that points to someone called "Dr. V."

## PC Accomplishments

[Example:]
- Successfully investigated crime scene; found all core clues (alchemical residue, surgical scars, journal fragment)
- Interviewed Constable Maren and survivor Tomas; learned attack was coordinated
- Defeated chimeric wolf pack in tactical combat; used terrain advantageously
- Salvaged alchemical samples and found torn fabric with noble seal (future clue)

## PC Setbacks or Ignored Hooks

[Example:]
- Did not visit Old Meg for additional monster lore (saved for later)
- One PC nearly fell through rotting floorboards during barn fight (failed Reflex save)
- Did not attempt to capture a wolf alive for study (killed all three)

## NPC Interactions

| NPC | What Happened | Attitude Change | Next Steps |
|-----|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| Master Jorah Silverchain | Assigned contract; evaluated heroes' professionalism | Professional → Impressed | Will assign Contract 2; grant full Order access |
| Constable Maren | Provided information about massacre; grateful for help | Neutral → Friendly | Will vouch for heroes if they need Watch assistance |
| Tomas (survivor) | Interviewed about attack; traumatized but cooperative | Frightened → Grateful | No immediate follow-up; may appear later as witness |

## Faction Clocks Updated

- **Order of the Silver Chain (Guild Reputation):** 4/8 → 5/8 (successful contract completion)
- **Crimson Quorum (The Awakening):** 0/8 → 1/8 (wolves killed civilians before heroes stopped them)

## Loot Granted

- **Contract Payment:** 20 gp per PC + 50 gp party bonus = 130 gp total (distributed among party)
- **Salvage:** 3× Chimeric Extract (10 gp each) = 30 gp
- **Evidence:** Torn fabric with noble seal (no gp value; story clue)

**Total Wealth Gained:** ~160 gp (party pool)

## Open Hooks for Next Session

1. **Who is "Dr. V"?** Journal fragment mentions alchemist creating enhanced creatures
2. **What is "the Quorum"?** Organization sponsoring monster creation
3. **Noble Seal:** Torn fabric from wolf lair has embroidered seal; whose house?
4. **More Attacks Coming:** If one set of chimeric wolves exists, are there more?
5. **Order Induction:** Jorah mentioned formal membership if heroes prove themselves

## GM Notes for Next Time

**What to Prep:**
- [ ] Contract 2: The Whispering Sickness (Millford village plague)
- [ ] Stat blocks for ghouls and ritual defense encounter
- [ ] Prepare Father Dorian NPC (priest of Pharasma)
- [ ] Update NPC tracker: Jorah's attitude improved

**Player Questions/Requests:**
- [Example:] One player asked about crafting alchemical items using Chimeric Extract; need to research rules
- [Example:] Party wants to know if Order library has info on "Quorum"—prepare research scene for Session 2

**Pacing Notes:**
- Crime scene investigation took longer than expected (~60 min instead of 45)—players were very thorough (good!)
- Combat was quick (~30 min); wolves went down faster than anticipated; consider slight buff to future encounters
- Party enjoyed investigation more than expected; lean into mystery elements

**Surprises:**
- [Example:] One PC tried to intimidate wolves to flee (creative!); worked well with Intimidation check
- [Example:] Party split to investigate barn from multiple angles; added tactical complexity (good teamwork)

## Meta Notes (Table Health)

**Pacing:** Just right—finished in 3.5 hours with good scene variety

**Engagement:**
- All players actively participated in investigation
- One player (PC name) took lead on interviewing witnesses (good roleplay)
- Combat engaged tactical players; everyone had moments to shine

**Safety Check:**
- Content warnings respected; no issues with massacre aftermath descriptions
- All players comfortable; no one used safety tools (X-Card, etc.)

**What Went Well:**
- Mystery setup intrigued players
- Master Jorah well-received (players like gruff mentor)
- Combat felt challenging but fair

**What to Improve:**
- Spend more time describing Thornhaven atmosphere (build setting)
- Telegraph monster abilities earlier (scent, pack tactics) so players can plan
- Provide more sensory details during travel scene

**Player Feedback (if gathered):**
- [Example:] "Love the investigation focus; feels like real detective work"
- [Example:] "Jorah is great; want to impress him"
- [Example:] "Excited to learn more about Dr. V and the Quorum"
