### Active Hooks (Update Each Session)

**Current Session: 1**

1. **Rivermeet Massacre:** Wedding party slaughtered; chimeric wolves fled into woods; witnesses traumatized
2. **Order Recruitment:** Master Jorah evaluating heroes for full membership
3. **Thornhaven Unrest:** Rumors of monsters increasing; Watch overwhelmed

**Unresolved (Add as campaign progresses):**
- 
- 
- 

### Session Prep Checklist

Before each session:
- [ ] Review previous session diary notes
- [ ] Update NPC attitudes based on last session's interactions
- [ ] Advance relevant clocks (Quorum, corruption, etc.)
- [ ] Prep next contract or conspiracy scene
- [ ] Prepare monster stat blocks (have weaknesses highlighted)
- [ ] Update active hooks list
- [ ] Prep 1-2 random encounters (in case players go off-script)
- [ ] Review any player questions from last time

### Investigation Quick Tips

**Core Clues (Always Provided):**
- What the monster is (general type)
- Where it likely lairs
- Recent attack locations/patterns

**Extra Clues (Reward Good Checks):**
- Specific weaknesses
- Tactical behaviors
- Connection to larger conspiracy
- Optional objectives (rescue survivors, gather components)

**Failed Checks:**
- Heroes still learn something, just not everything
- Or: It takes longer (trigger random encounter or clock advance)
- Never: Complete dead-end (bad game design)

### Pacing Knobs

**If Session Is Dragging:**
- Skip travel montage; cut to arrival
- Give core clue automatically; move to next scene
- Trigger dramatic interrupt (NPC arrives, monster attacks)

**If Session Is Too Fast:**
- Add investigation complication (witness lies, clue is red herring)
- Introduce NPC roleplay scene (Master Jorah checks in, Lady Mira requests meeting)
- Add random encounter during travel

### Emergency Cliffhangers

If you're running out of time mid-session, use one of these:

1. **Monster Appears:** The creature they're tracking ambushes them (initiative roll, end session)
2. **NPC Betrayal:** Someone they trust is revealed as Quorum agent
3. **Assassination Attempt:** Quorum sends killers after heroes (combat start, end session)
4. **Discovery:** Heroes find major clue (Venn's lab, Quorum meeting place) but hear enemies approaching
5. **Urgent Message:** Rider arrives with news of another attack—civilians in immediate danger

### Key Scenes Not to Skip

**Act I:**
- First contract (Rivermeet) — establishes investigation loop
- Meeting Master Jorah — establishes mentor relationship
- Confronting Venn at the Mill — reveals conspiracy

**Act II:**
- Meeting Lady Mira — establishes noble ally
- Infiltrating Crimson Estate — uncovers Quorum
- The Coup — major set-piece; turns heroes into heroes

**Act III:**
- Backwards Village — shows Sovereign's reality-warping power
- Dreaming Archive — reveals how to seal Sovereign
- Disrupting Morth's ritual — prevents immediate doom

**Act IV:**
- Defeating Morth — main villain confrontation
- Sealing ritual decision — defines campaign ending
- Epilogues — closure for players

### Common Player Questions & Answers

**Q: Can we negotiate with the monsters?**  
A: Some, yes! Intelligent creatures may talk. Mindless beasts or those magically compelled, no.

**Q: What if we want to capture rather than kill?**  
A: Encouraged! Bring captured creatures to Order for study; may provide extra clues or unlock new options.

**Q: Can we take corruption powers?**  
A: Optional mechanic; only if player wants it. Provide mechanical benefit + narrative cost. Requires buy-in.

**Q: What happens if we fail a contract?**  
A: Monster escapes; attacks again later (stronger); reputation hit; survivors may blame heroes.

**Q: Can we just storm the Crimson Estate and arrest everyone?**  
A: You can try! But without evidence, they have legal protection. And they're powerful enough to fight back or escape.

**Q: How do we know what to investigate?**  
A: Follow the monster hunting cycle: crime scene → witnesses → research → lair. Each step reveals next location.

### GM Self-Care Reminders

- **Don't over-prep:** Session plans never survive contact with players; prep scenes, not scripts
- **It's okay to say "I don't know, let me check":** Look up rules mid-session or make ruling and check later
- **Player creativity is good:** If they solve mystery "wrong way," roll with it; their solution is now correct
- **Take breaks:** 10-minute break every 90 minutes; everyone needs water/bathroom/mental reset
- **End on time:** Respect everyone's schedule; use emergency cliffhanger if needed

### Session Zero Completed?

- [ ] Safety tools (Lines/Veils/X-Card) established
- [ ] Character hooks integrated into backstories
- [ ] Table norms agreed upon (phones, food, scheduling)
- [ ] Investigation gameplay expectations set (note-taking, GM won't hand-hold)
- [ ] Optional corruption mechanics discussed
- [ ] Party composition balanced (skills covered, roles defined)
