# The Blackwood Contracts — Quick Start Guide

**For GMs Ready to Run Tonight**

---

## 30-Second Pitch

You're monster hunters investigating a series of unnatural attacks in the Blackwood March. What starts as contract work escalates into a conspiracy involving corrupt nobles, artificial monster creation, and an ancient void entity trying to break free from its prison. Think Witcher meets True Detective meets Bloodborne.

## What You Need

### Required Reading (20-30 minutes)
1. **This file** (you're reading it!)
2. **0_pitch.md** (Session Zero prep; player expectations)
3. **Session 01** (tonight's session; fully detailed)
4. **gm-cheatsheet.md** (one-page reference; keep open during play)

### Optional Reading (If You Have Time)
- **1_overview.md** (full campaign scope; read between sessions)
- **Act I summary** (acts/act-1.md; big picture for Sessions 1-8)
- **NPC files** (npc/master-jorah-silverchain.md, etc.; deepen character portrayal)

### Materials to Prepare
- **Stat blocks:** Chimeric Wolves (use Wolf stats from Bestiary p. 334 + modifications in enc-001)
- **Maps:** Optional (theater-of-the-mind works; grid for barn fight if you prefer tactical)
- **Handouts:** Contract letter from Jorah (can improvise or print from session outline)
- **Dice, character sheets, snacks, safety tools (X-Card)**

---

## Session Zero (30-60 minutes)

### Safety Discussion
**Read from 0_pitch.md:**
- **Lines:** Sexual violence, harm to children on-screen, permanent mind control
- **Veils:** Graphic torture, body horror transformations, mass casualties
- **Ask First:** Corruption mechanics, permanent disfigurement, character death stakes

**Establish protocol:**
- X-Card on table (tap to skip content, no questions)
- Script Change (rewind, fast-forward, pause)
- Open Door (can leave any time)

### Tone & Expectations
**Describe the campaign:**
> "You're professional monster hunters in a dark-fantasy frontier. Think Witcher—you investigate before you fight, prepare specialized gear, and not every monster deserves death. The campaign is mystery-driven: you'll piece together clues across 25+ sessions to uncover a conspiracy that threatens the entire region. Tone is dark but heroic—grim, but you can make a difference."

**Set gameplay expectations:**
- Investigation is core pillar (take notes; ask questions)
- Preparation matters (research monsters before fighting)
- Multiple solutions exist (combat, negotiation, cleverness)
- The world continues without you (ignore threats = consequences)
- Sessions are 3-4 hours; campaign is 6-9 months weekly play

### Character Creation
**Provide character hooks** (from 0_pitch.md):
1. Guild Initiate
2. Survivor
3. Scholar
4. Noble's Retainer
5. Haunted Hunter
6. Outsider Specialist

**Ask players:**
- Pick a hook OR create custom with GM
- How do you know each other? (established party or meeting at guildhall?)
- Any relationships to NPCs? (Jorah, Thornhaven locals, etc.)

**Recommended options:**
- **Classes:** Any (Investigator, Ranger, Alchemist fit theme but not required)
- **Skills:** Spread coverage (Nature, Occultism, Medicine, Society, Survival, Diplomacy)
- **Ancestries/Backgrounds:** Any (tie to Blackwood March or travelers from elsewhere)

**Optional rule:**
- Free Archetype variant (recommended; adds flexibility)

## Running Session 01 (3-4 hours)

### Opening (15-20 min)
**Scene:** Silverchain Guildhall, Thornhaven

**Read aloud from session-01.md:**
> "The city of Thornhaven wakes to another gray morning..."

**Introduce Master Jorah:**
- Grizzled dwarf, eyepatch, scars
- Gruff but professional
- Assigns first contract: Rivermeet Manor massacre

**Let players:**
- Ask questions about contract
- Request supplies (50 gp budget)
- Roleplay character introductions

### Travel (30 min)
**Scene:** River road to Rivermeet

**Purpose:**
- Character bonding (how do they interact?)
- Build tension (describe fog, crows, uneasy atmosphere)
- Optional skill checks (tracks on road, lore about Rivermeet)

**Keep it moving:**
- Don't bog down; narrate journey unless players initiate roleplay
- 4 hours in-game = 15-30 minutes real-time

### Crime Scene Investigation (45-60 min)
**Scene:** Rivermeet Manor courtyard

**Core clues (always provide):**
1. Wolf tracks (bipedal sometimes)
2. Alchemical residue on wounds
3. Surgical scars on shed fur
4. Journal fragment ("Dr. V" and "the Quorum")

**Extra clues (if players roll well or search thoroughly):**
- Witness testimony (Tomas describes coordinated attack)
- Attack pattern (strategic, not mindless)
- Chemical analysis (transmutation alchemy)

**GM tips:**
- Describe crime scene clinically, not graphically (respect Veils)
- Let players drive investigation (they ask questions; you answer)
- Don't gate-keep core clues behind rolls (provide regardless)
- Reward good rolls with extra details

**NPCs:**
- Constable Maren (grateful, overwhelmed)
- Tomas (traumatized survivor; needs gentle handling)
- Priest of Pharasma (solemn; mentions wounds are "unclean")

### Optional: Research Interlude (15-20 min)
**If players return to Thornhaven to research:**

**Library (Silverchain Guildhall):**
- Chimeric creatures exist in lore
- Creating them requires advanced alchemy
- "Crimson Quorum" not in records

**Old Meg (hermit 3 miles north):**
- Confirms chimeric work
- Sells alchemist's fire (3 gp each)
- Warns: "Fire works well against them"

**Preparation:**
- Let players craft, buy, or plan tactics
- Note what they prepare (grant +1 bonus later)

### The Hunt (60-75 min)
**Scene:** Collapsed barn in forest

**Environment:**
- Difficult terrain (rubble)
- Partial cover (walls)
- Dim light
- Rotting floorboards (hazard)

**Encounter:**
- 3× Chimeric Wolves (modified wolves; see enc-001 or gm-cheatsheet)
- Use pack tactics (flank, Trip)
- Two heads (scent, harder to flank)
- Alchemical rage (1 HP comeback on failed save)

**Tactics:**
- Wolves go after nearest target
- Flank when possible
- Retreat if 2+ drop

**Alternatives to combat:**
- Set trap (Survival DC 17)
- Sneak attack (Stealth DC 18 group check)
- Intimidate to flee (DC 20 + visible threat)

**Reward preparation:**
- If players used fire: Describe wolves flinching, taking extra damage
- If players researched: Confirm weaknesses ("your notes were right!")

**Aftermath:**
- Examine corpses (confirm surgical scars, alchemical organs)
- Find torn fabric with noble seal (clue for future session)
- Salvage Chimeric Extract (10 gp value × 3)

### Closing (10-15 min)
**Scene:** Return to Thornhaven

**Debrief with Jorah:**
- Report findings
- Receive payment (20 gp/PC + 50 gp bonus)
- Jorah impressed: "Good work. Fast, clean. That's how it's done."

**Hook for next session:**
- Jorah mentions another contract incoming (Millford plague)
- Players can research "Dr. V" or "Quorum" if they want
- Award Level 2 if players completed 2-3 contracts (milestone)

**End session:**
- Ask for feedback ("How was it? What interested you most?")
- Preview next session ("Village struck by plague that turns victims into ghouls")

## GM Cheat Sheet (Keep Handy)

### DCs (Level 1)
- Very Easy: 13
- Easy: 15
- Moderate: 17
- Hard: 20
- Very Hard: 23

### Chimeric Wolf Stats (Quick Reference)
- **AC:** 15
- **HP:** 24
- **Attacks:** Bite +7 (1d6+2 piercing + Trip), Claw +7 (1d4+2 slashing)
- **Special:** Two heads (scent 30 feet, +2 to avoid being flanked), Alchemical Rage (Fort DC 15 to stay at 1 HP when dropped)

### NPCs (Quick Portrayal)
- **Jorah:** Gruff dwarf, direct, taps desk when thinking, calls players "you lot"
- **Constable Maren:** Overwhelmed, grateful, pale and shaken
- **Tomas:** Traumatized survivor, needs gentle handling, describes "wolves with human eyes"

### Pacing Knobs
- **Too slow?** Skip travel, give core clues automatically, trigger dramatic interrupt
- **Too fast?** Add NPC interaction, describe atmosphere more, insert minor complication

### Emergency Cliffhangers
1. End on initiative roll (wolves attack)
2. Heroes find lair but hear more growls (reinforcements?)
3. Cloaked figure watches from forest (Venn spying?)

## Common Questions

**Q: What if players fail investigation checks?**  
A: Provide core clues anyway (pass/fail just determines how much detail). Never dead-end.

**Q: What if players want to capture a wolf alive?**  
A: Great idea! Allow nonlethal attacks. Captured wolf can be studied (provides extra clues or sold to Order for 50 gp).

**Q: What if players go off-script (e.g., try to investigate Lord Morth immediately)?**  
A: Let them try! He's politically protected (need evidence to even meet him). Constable Kael warns them. They'll hit narrative wall but learn about obstacles.

**Q: What if combat is too easy/hard?**  
A: Easy = Add 1 wolf or upgrade one to elite. Hard = Remove 1 wolf or let them flee after 2 rounds.

**Q: What if players don't take notes?**  
A: Provide recap at start of each session. If they forget key clues, NPCs can remind them ("Didn't you find that journal fragment?").

**Q: Do I need to read the entire campaign before running Session 1?**  
A: No! Just this guide + Session 01 + gm-cheatsheet. Campaign is structured so you can prep 2-3 sessions ahead.

## After Session 01

### Immediate Prep (For Session 2)
1. Read **session-02.md** (Whispering Sickness)
2. Stat ghouls (Bestiary p. 186)
3. Prepare Father Dorian NPC (priest of Pharasma)
4. Update faction clocks (Guild Reputation +1, Quorum Awakening +1)

### Optional Expansion
- Read full **1_overview.md** (understand campaign scope)
- Read **act-1.md** (see how Sessions 1-8 connect)
- Flesh out Thornhaven (improvise street names, taverns, NPCs)

### Player Feedback
Ask:
- "How was the investigation? Too easy/hard?"
- "Did you enjoy the monster-hunting cycle?"
- "Which NPCs did you like?"
- "What mysteries intrigue you?"

Use answers to adjust future sessions.

## You're Ready!

**Confidence check:**
- [x] I've read Session 01
- [x] I have wolf stats ready
- [x] I understand investigation structure (provide core clues always)
- [x] I know Jorah's personality (gruff mentor)
- [x] I have safety tools in place (X-Card, etc.)

**If yes to all:** You're good to go. Run Session 01 and have fun!

**If no to any:** Spend 10 more minutes on that item. The campaign is designed to be GM-friendly—you don't need to memorize everything.

---

## Final Tips

1. **Trust the structure:** Investigation → Research → Prepare → Hunt works. Let players explore it.
2. **Reward creativity:** Players will surprise you. Roll with it. Their solutions are valid.
3. **Fail forward:** Failed checks complicate, they don't stop progress.
4. **NPCs are tools:** Jorah, Maren, Meg can provide hints if players are stuck.
5. **It's okay to improvise:** You have the scaffolding. Add details as needed.
6. **Have fun:** This is a dark setting but fun campaign. Lean into the mystery, enjoy NPC voices, celebrate player cleverness.

**Good luck, GM! Welcome to the Blackwood March.**
